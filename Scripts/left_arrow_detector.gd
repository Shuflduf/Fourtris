# CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

#1.      Overview.
#
#a.      Applicability. This agreement applies to the Windows software that is preinstalled on your device, or acquired from a retailer and installed by you, the media on which you received the software (if any), any fonts, icons, images or sound files included with the software, and also any Microsoft updates, upgrades, supplements or services for the software, unless other terms come with them. It also applies to Windows apps developed by Microsoft that provide functionality such as mail, contacts, music and photos that are included with and are a part of Windows. If this agreement contains terms regarding a feature or service not available on your device, then those terms do not apply.
#
#b.      Additional terms. Additional Microsoft and third-party terms may apply to your use of certain features, services and apps, depending on your device’s capabilities, how it is configured, and how you use it. Please be sure to read them.
#
#(i)      Some Windows apps provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services Agreement at (aka.ms/msa). You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service terms of use or the app’s settings, as applicable. The services may not be available in all regions.
#
#(ii)     Microsoft, the device manufacturer or installer may include additional apps, which will be subject to separate license terms and privacy policies.
#
#(iii)    The software includes Adobe Flash Player that is licensed under terms from Adobe Systems Incorporated at (aka.ms/adobeflash). Adobe and Flash are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated in the United States and/or other countries.
#
#(iv)    The software may include third-party programs that are licensed to you under this agreement, or under their own terms. License terms, notices and acknowledgements, if any, for the third-party programs can be viewed at (aka.ms/thirdpartynotices).
#
#(v)     To the extent included with Windows, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote are licensed for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you have commercial use rights under a separate agreement.
#
#2.      Installation and Use Rights.
#
#a.      License. The software is licensed, not sold. Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device), for use by one person at a time, so long as you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Updating or upgrading from non-genuine software with software from Microsoft or authorized sources does not make your original version or the updated/upgraded version genuine, and in that situation, you do not have a license to use the software.
#
#b.      Device. In this agreement, “device” means a hardware system (whether physical or virtual) with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a device.
#
#c.      Restrictions. The device manufacturer or installer and Microsoft reserve all rights (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement. For example, this license does not give you any right to, and you may not:
#
#(i)      use or virtualize features of the software separately;
#
#(ii)     publish, copy (other than the permitted backup copy), rent, lease, or lend the software;
#
#(iii)    transfer the software (except as permitted by this agreement);
#
#(iv)    work around any technical restrictions or limitations in the software;
#
#(v)     use the software as server software, for commercial hosting, make the software available for simultaneous use by multiple users over a network, install the software on a server and allow users to access it remotely, or install the software on a device for use only by remote users;
#
#(vi)    reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or attempt to do so, except and only to the extent that the foregoing restriction is (a) permitted by applicable law; (b) permitted by licensing terms governing the use of open-source components that may be included with the software; or (c) required to debug changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License which are included with and linked to by the software; and
#
#(vii)   when using Internet-based features you may not use those features in any way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them, or to try to gain access to or use any service, data, account, or network, in an unauthorized manner.
#
#d.      Multi use scenarios.
#
#(i)      Multiple versions. If when acquiring the software you were provided with multiple versions (such as 32-bit and 64-bit versions), you may install and activate only one of those versions at a time.
#
#(ii)     Multiple or pooled connections. Hardware or software you use to multiplex or pool connections, or reduce the number of devices or users that access or use the software, does not reduce the number of licenses you need. You may only use such hardware or software if you have a license for each instance of the software you are using.
#
#(iii)    Device connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access the software installed on the licensed device for the purpose of using the following software features: file services, print services, Internet information services, and Internet connection sharing and telephony services on the licensed device. You may allow any number of devices to access the software on the licensed device to synchronize data between devices. This section does not mean, however, that you have the right to install the software, or use the primary function of the software (other than the features listed in this section), on any of these other devices.
#
#(iv)    Use in a virtualized environment. This license allows you to install only one instance of the software for use on one device, whether that device is physical or virtual. If you want to use the software on more than one virtual device, you must obtain a separate license for each instance.
#
#(v)     Remote access. No more than once every 90 days, you may designate a single user who physically uses the licensed device as the licensed user. The licensed user may access the licensed device from another device using remote access technologies. Other users, at different times, may access the licensed device from another device using remote access technologies, but only on devices separately licensed to run the same or higher edition of this software.
#
#(vi)    Remote assistance. You may use remote assistance technologies to share an active session without obtaining any additional licenses for the software. Remote assistance allows one user to connect directly to another user’s computer, usually to correct problems.
#
#e.      Backup copy. You may make a single copy of the software for backup purposes, and may also use that backup copy to transfer the software if it was acquired as stand-alone software, as described in Section 4 below.
#
#3.      Privacy; Consent to Use of Data. Your privacy is important to us. Some of the software features send or receive information when using those features. Many of these features can be switched off in the user interface, or you can choose not to use them. By accepting this agreement and using the software you agree that Microsoft may collect, use, and disclose the information as described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement (aka.ms/privacy), and as may be described in the user interface associated with the software features.
#
#4.      Transfer. The provisions of this section do not apply if you acquired the software in Germany or in any of the countries listed on this site (aka.ms/transfer), in which case any transfer of the software to a third party, and the right to use it, must comply with applicable law.
#
#a.      Software preinstalled on device. If you acquired the software preinstalled on a device (and also if you upgraded from software preinstalled on a device), you may transfer the license to use the software directly to another user, only with the licensed device. The transfer must include the software and, if provided with the device, an authentic Windows label including the product key. Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.
#
#b.      Stand-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.
#
#5.      Authorized Software and Activation. You are authorized to use this software only if you are properly licensed and the software has been properly activated with a genuine product key or by other authorized method. When you connect to the Internet while using the software, the software will automatically contact Microsoft or its affiliate to conduct activation to associate it with a certain device. You can also activate the software manually by Internet or telephone. In either case, transmission of certain information will occur, and Internet, telephone and SMS service charges may apply. During activation (or reactivation that may be triggered by changes to your device’s components), the software may determine that the installed instance of the software is counterfeit, improperly licensed or includes unauthorized changes. If activation fails, the software will attempt to repair itself by replacing any tampered Microsoft software with genuine Microsoft software. You may also receive reminders to obtain a proper license for the software. Successful activation does not confirm that the software is genuine or properly licensed. You may not bypass or circumvent activation. To help determine if your software is genuine and whether you are properly licensed, see (aka.ms/genuine). Certain updates, support, and other services might only be offered to users of genuine Microsoft software.
#
#6.      Updates. The softwareperiodically checks for system and app updates, and downloads and installs them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources, and Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with those updates. By accepting this agreement, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.
#
#7.      Downgrade Rights. If you acquired a device from a manufacturer or installer with a Professional version of Windows preinstalled on it and it is configured to run in full feature mode, you may use either a Windows 8.1 Pro or Windows 7 Professional version, but only for so long as Microsoft provides support for that earlier version as set forth in (aka.ms/windowslifecycle). This agreement applies to your use of the earlier versions. If the earlier version includes different components, any terms for those components in the agreement that comes with the earlier version apply to your use of such components. Neither the device manufacturer or installer, nor Microsoft, is obligated to supply earlier versions to you. You must obtain the earlier version separately, for which you may be charged a fee. At any time, you may replace an earlier version with the version you originally acquired.
#
#8.      Export Restrictions. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit  (aka.ms/exporting).
#
#9.      Warranty, Disclaimer, Remedy, Damages and Procedures.
#
#a.      Limited Warranty. Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, Microsoft, or the device manufacturer or installer, warrants that properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. This limited warranty does not cover problems that you cause, that arise when you fail to follow instructions, or that are caused by events beyond the reasonable control of Microsoft, or the device manufacturer or installer. The limited warranty starts when the first user acquires the software, and lasts for one year if acquired from Microsoft, or for 90 days if acquired from a device manufacturer or installer. If you obtain updates or supplements directly from Microsoft during the 90-day term of the device manufacturer’s or installer’s limited warranty, Microsoft provides the limited warranty for those updates or supplements. Any supplements, updates, or replacement software that you may receive from Microsoft during that year are also covered, but only for the remainder of that one-year period if acquired from Microsoft, or for 90 days if acquired from a device manufacturer or installer, or for 30 days, whichever is longer. Transferring the software will not extend the limited warranty.
#
#b.      Disclaimer. Neither Microsoft, nor the device manufacturer or installer, gives any other express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. Microsoft and the devicemanufacturer and installerexclude all implied warranties and conditions, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. If your local law does not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, then any implied warranties, guarantees, or conditions last only during the term of the limited warranty and are limited as much as your local law allows. If your local law requires a longer limited warranty term, despite this agreement, then that longer term will apply, but you can recover only the remedies this agreement allows.
#
#c.      Limited Remedy. If Microsoft, or the device manufacturer or installer, breaches its limited warranty, it will, at its election, either: (i) repair or replace the software at no charge, or (ii) accept return of the software (or at its election the device on which the software was preinstalled) for a refund of the amount paid, if any. The device manufacturer or installer (or Microsoft if you acquired them directly from Microsoft) may also repair or replace supplements, updates, and replacement of the software or provide a refund of the amount you paid for them, if any. These are your only remedies for breach of warranty. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state or country to country.
#
#d.      Damages. Except for any repair, replacement, or refund that Microsoft, or the device manufacturer or installer, may provide, you may not under this limited warranty, under any other part of this agreement, or under any theory, recover any damages or other remedy, including lost profits or direct, consequential, special, indirect, or incidental damages. The damage exclusions and remedy limitations in this agreement apply even if repair, replacement, or a refund does not fully compensate you for any losses, if Microsoft, or the device manufacturer or installer, knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages, or if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages, so those limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. If your local law allows you to recover damages from Microsoft, or the device manufacturer or installer, even though this agreement does not, you cannot recover more than you paid for the software (or up to $50 USD if you acquired the software for no charge).
#
#e.      Warranty and Refund Procedures. For service or refund, you must provide a copy of your proof of purchase and comply with Microsoft’s return policies if you acquired the software from Microsoft, or the device manufacturer’s or installer’s return policies if you acquired the software from a device manufacturer or installer. If you purchased stand-alone software, those return policies might require you to uninstall the software and return it to Microsoft. If you acquired the software pre-installed on a device, those return policies may require return of the software with the entire device on which the software is installed; the certificate of authenticity label including the product key (if provided with your device) must remain affixed. Contact the device manufacturer or installer at the address or toll-free telephone number provided with your device to find out how to obtain warranty service for the software. If Microsoft is your device manufacturer or if you acquired the software from a retailer, contact Microsoft at:
#
#(i)      United States and Canada. For warranty service or information about how to obtain a refund for software acquired in the United States or Canada, contact Microsoft via telephone at (800) MICROSOFT; via mail at Microsoft Customer Service and Support, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399; or visit (aka.ms/nareturns).
#
#(ii)     Europe, Middle East, and Africa. If you acquired the software in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, contact either Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, Customer Care Centre, Atrium Building Block B, Carmanhall Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin 18, Ireland, or the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (aka.ms/msoffices).
#
#(iii)    Australia. If you acquired the software in Australia, contact Microsoft to make a claim at 13 20 58; or Microsoft Pty Ltd, 1 Epping Road, North Ryde NSW 2113 Australia.
#
#(iv)    Other countries. If you acquired the software in another country, contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (aka.ms/msoffices).
#
#10.    Support.
#
#a.      For software preinstalled on a device. For the software generally, contact the device manufacturer or installer for support options. Refer to the support number provided with the software. For updates and supplements obtained directly from Microsoft, Microsoft may provide limited support services for properly licensed software as described at (aka.ms/mssupport).
#
#b.      For software acquired from a retailer. Microsoft provides limited support services for properly licensed software as described at (aka.ms/mssupport).
#
#11.    Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver if You Live in (or, if a Business, Your Principal Place of Business is in) the United States.
#
#We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. “We,” “our,” and “us” includes Microsoft, the device manufacturer, and software installer.
#
#a.      Disputes covered—everything except IP. The term “dispute” is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and the device manufacturer or installer, or you and Microsoft, concerning the software, its price, or this agreement, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.
#
#b.      Mail aNotice of Dispute first. If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to the device manufacturer or installer, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT. If your dispute is with Microsoft, mail it to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. A form is available at (aka.ms/disputeform). We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.
#
#c.      Small claims court option. Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, and if you meet the court’s requirements, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington USA if your dispute is with Microsoft.
#
#d.      Arbitration procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the software for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 USD or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the software, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see (aka.ms/adr) or call 1-800-778-7879. To start an arbitration, submit the form available at (aka.ms/arbitration) to the AAA; mail a copy to the device manufacturer or installer (or to Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft). In a dispute involving $25,000 USD or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington if your dispute is with Microsoft. You choose. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim. Under AAA rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim. But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.
#
#e.      Arbitration fees and payments.
#
#(i)      Disputes involving $75,000 USD or less. The device manufacturer or installer (or Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft) will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, the device manufacturer or installer (or Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft) will: (1) pay the greater of the award or $1,000 USD; (2) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (3) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.
#
#(ii)     Disputes involving more than $75,000 USD. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
#
#f.       Must file within one year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes — see Section 11.a.) within one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it’s permanently barred.
#
#g.      Severability. If any part of Section 11 (Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class-wide or representative arbitration, Section 11 will be unenforceable in its entirety.
#
#h.      Conflict with AAA rules. This agreement governs if it conflicts with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.
#
#i.       Microsoft as party or third-party beneficiary. If Microsoft is the device manufacturer or if you acquired the software from a retailer, Microsoft is a party to this agreement. Otherwise, Microsoft is not a party but is a third-party beneficiary of your agreement with the device manufacturer or installer to resolve disputes through informal negotiation and arbitration.
#
#12.    Governing Law. The laws of the state or country where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern all claims and disputes concerning the software, its price, or this agreement, including breach of contract claims and claims under consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, implied warranty laws, for unjust enrichment, and in tort, regardless of conflict of law principles. In the United States, the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration.
#
#13.    Consumer Rights, Regional Variations. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
#
#a.      Australia. References to “Limited Warranty” are references to the express warranty provided by Microsoft or the device manufacturer or installer. This warranty is given in addition to other rights and remedies you may have under law, including your rights and remedies under the Australian Consumer Law consumer guarantees. Nothing in this agreement limits or changes those rights and remedies. In particular:.
#
#(i)      the provisions excluding and limiting warranties, guarantees, damages and remedies, and limiting duration of your rights under local laws in Section 9 headed Warranty, Disclaimer, Remedy, Damages and Procedures do not apply to the Australian Consumer Law consumer guarantees and your rights and remedies under them;
#
#(ii)     support and refund policies referred to in Section 10 are subject to the Australian Consumer Law;
#
#(iii)    the Australian Consumer Law consumer guarantees apply to the evaluation software described in Section 14 d (ii) and the preview software described in Section 14 d (iv); and
#
#(iv)    our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. In this section, “goods” refers to the software for which Microsoft, the device manufacturer or installer provides the express warranty. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure.
#
#To learn more about your rights under the Australian Consumer Law, please review the information at (aka.ms/acl).
#
#b.      Canada. You may stop receiving updates on your device by turning off Internet access. If and when you re-connect to the Internet, the software will resume checking for and installing updates.
#
#c.      European Union. The academic use restriction in Section 14.d(i) below does not apply in the jurisdictions listed on this site: (aka.ms/academicuse).
#
#d.      Germany and Austria.
#
#(i)      Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, the device manufacturer or installer, and Microsoft, give no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
#
#(ii)     Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, the device manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
#
#Subject to the preceding sentence, the device manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if the device manufacturer or installer or Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, the device manufacturer or installer or Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.
#
#e.      Other regions. See (aka.ms/variations) for a current list of regional variations.
#
#14.    Additional Notices.

# This file aims at documenting the copyright and license for every source
# file in the Godot Engine repository, and especially outline the files
# whose license differs from the MIT/Expat license used by Godot Engine.
#
# It is written as a machine-readable format following the debian/copyright
# specification. Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect
# all corresponding files (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those
# with a more explicit copyright statement.
#
# Licenses are given with their debian/copyright short name (or SPDX identifier
# if no standard short name exists) and are all included in plain text at the
# end of this file (in alphabetical order).
#
# Disclaimer for thirdparty libraries:
# ------------------------------------
#
# Licensing details for thirdparty libraries in the 'thirdparty/' directory
# are given in summarized form, i.e. with only the "main" license described
# in the library's license statement. Different licenses of single files or
# code snippets in thirdparty libraries are not documented here.
# For example:
#   Files: ./thirdparty/zlib/
#   Copyright: 1995-2017, Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler
#   License: Zlib
# The exact copyright for each file in that library *may* differ, and some
# files or code snippets might be distributed under other compatible licenses
# (e.g. a public domain dedication), but as far as Godot Engine is concerned
# the library is considered as a whole under the Zlib license.
#
# Note: When linking dynamically against thirdparty libraries instead of
# building them into the Godot binary, you may remove the corresponding
# license details from this file.

#
#License: CC0-1.0
# CC0 1.0 Universal
# .
# Statement of Purpose
# .
# The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
# exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
# subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
# authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
# .
# Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
# purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
# works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
# claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
# and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
# purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
# contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
# further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
# reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
# efforts of others.
# .
# For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
# of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
# Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
# and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
# and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
# Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
# effect of CC0 on those rights.
# .
# 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
# protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
# Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
# to, the following:
# .
# i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
# and translate a Work;
# .
# ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
# .
# iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
# depicted in a Work;
# .
# iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
# subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
# .
# v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
# a Work;
# .
# vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
# European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
# protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
# including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
# .
# vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
# based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
# .
# 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
# applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
# unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
# and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
# known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
# action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
# duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
# extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
# copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
# commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
# the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
# detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
# shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
# any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
# by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
# .
# 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
# judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
# shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
# Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
# is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
# non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
# unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
# the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
# provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
# in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
# purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
# promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
# of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
# License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
# applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
# invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
# affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
# Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
# and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
# Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
# .
# 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
# .
# a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
# surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
# .
# b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
# of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
# including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
# for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
# other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
# discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
# .
# c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
# that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
# any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
# disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
# or other rights required for any use of the Work.
# .
# d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
# party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
# CC0 or use of the Work.

# performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
# Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
# categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
# specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
# Rights.
# .
# d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
# absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
# fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
# Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
# agreements.
# .
# e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or

# License.
# .
# g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
# terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
# all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
# Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

# dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
# available to the public including in ways that members of the
# public may access the material from a place and at a time
# individually chosen by them.
# .
# j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
# resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
# the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
# as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
# equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
# .
# k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
# under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
# .
# Section 2 -- Scope.
# .
# a. License grant.
# .
# 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
# the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
# non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
# exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
# .
# a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
# in part; and
# .
# b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
# .
# 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
# Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
# License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
# its terms and conditions.
# .
# 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
# 6(a).
# .
# 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
# Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
# all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
# and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
# Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
# authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
# necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
# technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
# Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
# simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
# (4) never produces Adapted Material.
# .
# 5. Downstream recipients.
# .
# a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
# recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
# receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
# Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
# Public License.
# .
# b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
# any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
# apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
# Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
# Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
# Material.
# .
# 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
# may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
# are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
# with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
# the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
# provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
# .
# b. Other rights.
# .
# 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
# licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
# privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
# the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
# assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
# extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
# Rights, but not otherwise.
# .
# 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
# Public License.
# .
# 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
# collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
# Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
# under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
# licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
# reserves any right to collect such royalties.
# .
# Section 3 -- License Conditions.
# .
# Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
# following conditions.
# .
# a. Attribution.
# .
# 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
# form), You must:
# .
# a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
# with the Licensed Material:
# .
# i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
# Material and any others designated to receive
# attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
# the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
# designated);
# .
# ii. a copyright notice;
# .

# extent reasonably practicable;
# .

# .
# 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
# reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
# which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
# reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
# hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
# information.
# .
# 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
# information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
# reasonably practicable.
# .
# 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
# License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
# Material from complying with this Public License.
# .
# Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
# .
# Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
# apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
# .
# a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
# to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
# portion of the contents of the database;
# .
# b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
# contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
# Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
# Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
# .
# c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
# all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
# .
# For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
# replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
# Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
# .
# Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
# .
# a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
# EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
# AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
# ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
# IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
# WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
# PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
# ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
# KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
# ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
# .
# b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
# TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
# NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
# INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
# COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
# USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
# ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
# DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
# IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
# .
# c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
# above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
# possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
# waiver of all liability.
# .
# Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
# .
# a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
# Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
# this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
# terminate automatically.
# .
# b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
# Section 6(a), it reinstates:
# .
# 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
# it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
# violation; or
# .
# 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
# .
# For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
# right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
# of this Public License.
# .
# c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
# Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
# distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so

# .
# d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
# License.
# .
# Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
# .
# a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
# terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
# .
# b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
# Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
# independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
# .
# Section 8 -- Interpretation.
# .
# a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
# shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
# conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
# be made without permission under this Public License.
# .
# b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
# deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
# minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
# cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
# without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
# conditions.
# .
# c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
# failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
# Licensor.
# .
# d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
# as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
# that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
# processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

#License: glslang
# Here, glslang proper means core GLSL parsing, HLSL parsing, and SPIR-V code
# generation. Glslang proper requires use of a number of licenses, one that covers
# preprocessing and others that covers non-preprocessing.
# .
# Bison was removed long ago. You can build glslang from the source grammar,
# using tools of your choice, without using bison or any bison files.
# .
# Other parts, outside of glslang proper, include:
# .
# - gl_types.h, only needed for OpenGL-like reflection, and can be left out of
#   a parse and codegen project.  See it for its license.
# .
# - update_glslang_sources.py, which is not part of the project proper and does
#   not need to be used.
# .
# - the SPIR-V "remapper", which is optional, but has the same license as
#   glslang proper
# .
# - Google tests and SPIR-V tools, and anything in the external subdirectory
#   are external and optional; see them for their respective licenses.

# Introduction
# ============
# .
# The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
# some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
# various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
# FreeType Project.
# .
# This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
# which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
# affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
# documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
# .
# This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
# (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
# and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
# alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
# .
#   o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
#     interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
# .
#   o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
#     full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
# .
#   o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
#     it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
#     somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
#     FreeType code. (`credits')
# .
# We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
# software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
# We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and

# distributes such Contribution.
# .
# 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
# .
# The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
# this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
# distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
# Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
# Contributor:
# .
# (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
#     or
# .
# (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's

#     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
#     Version); or
# .
# (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
#     its Contributions.
# .
# This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
# or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
# the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
# .
# 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
# .
# No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

# permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
# .
# 2.5. Representation

# Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
# to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
# .
# 2.6. Fair Use
# .
# This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under

# .
# 3. Responsibilities
# -------------------
# .
# 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
# .
# All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
# Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
# the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
# Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
# License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
# attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
# Form.
# .
# 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
# .
# If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
# .
# (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
#     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
#     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
#     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
#     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
# .
# (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
#     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
#     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
#     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
# .
# 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
# .
# You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
# provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
# the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
# Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
# Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
# License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
# under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
# the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
# Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
# License(s).
# .
# 3.4. Notices
# .
# You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
# (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
# or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
# the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
# the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
# .
# 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
# .
# You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
# indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
# Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
# behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
# such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
# You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
# liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
# indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
# disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
# jurisdiction.
# .
# 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
# ---------------------------------------------------
# .
# If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
# License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
# statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
# the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
# describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
# be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
# Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
# or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
# recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
# .
# 5. Termination
# --------------
# .
# 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
# if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
# compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
# Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
# Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
# ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
# non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
# come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
# Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
# notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
# first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
# from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
# Your receipt of the notice.
# .
# 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
# infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
# counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
# directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
# You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
# 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
# .
# 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
# end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
# have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
# prior to termination shall survive termination.
# .

# *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

# 9. Miscellaneous
# ----------------
# .
# This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
# matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
# unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
# necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides

#
#A. Definitions
#
#Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.
#
#    An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
#    The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy.
#    "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
#    “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
#    “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
#    The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
#    “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).
#    The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as electronjs.org. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.
#
#B. Account Terms
#
#Short version: Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.
#1. Account Controls
#
#    Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
#
#    Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.
#
#2. Required Information
#
#You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.
#3. Account Requirements
#
#We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.
#
#    You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
#    A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
#    One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
#    You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
#    Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
#    You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our Export Controls policy.
#
#4. Account Security
#
#You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.
#
#    You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
#    You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
#    You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the GitHub Support portal if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.
#
#5. Additional Terms
#
#In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.
#
#If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
#
#If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
#C. Acceptable Use
#
#Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.
#
#Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.
#
#You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines.
#D. User-Generated Content
#
#Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.
#1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
#
#You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.
#2. GitHub May Remove Content
#
#We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitHub terms or policies. User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.
#3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
#
#You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.
#
#Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.
#4. License Grant to Us
#
#We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.
#
#This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program.
#5. License Grant to Other Users
#
#Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).
#
#If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.
#6. Contributions Under Repository License
#
#Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.
#
#Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.
#7. Moral Rights
#
#You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.
#
#To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
#E. Private Repositories
#
#Short version: We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.
#1. Control of Private Repositories
#
#Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.
#2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories
#
#GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.
#3. Access
#
#GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Statement.
#
#You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:
#
#    You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.
#
#Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.
#
#GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.
#F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
#
#If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.
#
#We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.
#G. Intellectual Property Notice
#
#Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.
#1. GitHub's Rights to Content
#
#GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.
#2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos
#
#If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.
#3. License to GitHub Policies
#
#This Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.
#H. API Terms
#
#Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.
#
#Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.
#
#You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.
#
#You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.
#
#All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement.
#
#GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.
#I. GitHub Additional Product Terms
#
#Short version: You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.
#
#Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the GitHub Additional Product Terms.
#J. Beta Previews
#
#Short version: Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.
#1. Subject to Change
#
#Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.
#2. Confidentiality
#
#As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.
#
#Confidentiality Obligations. You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).
#
#Exceptions. Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.
#3. Feedback
#
#We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.
#K. Payment
#
#Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.
#1. Pricing
#
#Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.
#2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes
#
#    We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
#    If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
#    If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
#    You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.
#
#3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds
#
#Payment Based on Plan For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
#
#Payment Based on Usage Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details.
#
#Invoicing For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.
#4. Authorization
#
#By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.
#5. Responsibility for Payment
#
#You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the GitHub Support portal. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.
#L. Cancellation and Termination
#
#Short version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.
#1. Account Cancellation
#
#It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.
#2. Upon Cancellation
#
#We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your Account is canceled.
#
#We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.
#
#Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.
#3. GitHub May Terminate
#
#GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
#4. Survival
#
#All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
#M. Communications with GitHub
#
#Short version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.
#1. Electronic Communication Required
#
#For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.
#2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing
#

#The Lenovo Sales Agreement (“Agreement”) is made between you (the “Customer”) and Lenovo (Canada) Inc., 55 Idema Rd., Markam, ON L3R 1A9 (“Lenovo”). 
#
#
#
#Unless there is a different written sales agreement in place between Lenovo and Customer, this Agreement, including associated warranty statements, license agreements, and any applicable attachments, is the sole and complete agreement between Customer and Lenovo regarding the Products or Services purchased by Customer. Any additional or different terms in any order or communication from Customer shall not be binding on Lenovo unless signed by an authorized representative of Lenovo.
#
#
#
#Products and Services purchased on Lenovo’s website, Lenovo.com are subject to the US Export Administration Regulations. They are for Customer’s own use within the territory in which they are purchased and may not be resold except by an Authorized Lenovo Reseller, exported or reexported to other territories. Lenovo reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order in which Lenovo suspects the Customer is purchasing Products or Services for the purpose of reselling or exporting them. By moving forward with this order, you confirm that you agree you will not resell, export or reexport all Products and Services in violation of this agreement.
#
#
#
#Customer accepts the terms of this Agreement when ordering online on Lenovo.com or, when ordering by any other means, by opening the package containing the product or accepting a Service from Lenovo. Placing on order on Lenovo.com or inputting information on Lenovo.com does not mean Lenovo has accepted an order through its website. Lenovo only accepts Customer’s order by shipping the hardware Product or making the software Product available to Customer; or providing the Service. Confirmation of receipt of Customer’s order placed on Lenovo.com shall not mean Lenovo has accepted Customer’s order.
#
#
#
#1. Definitions
#
#
#
#1.1 Product shall mean any Lenovo branded or third party hardware or software that Lenovo provides to Customer under this Agreement. Hardware products include computers and accessories. Software products include computer software programs (whether pre-loaded, provided separately, or provided as a subscription service) and related licensed materials such as documentation.
#
#
#
#1.2 Service is the performance of a task; provision of advice or assistance; or access to a resource such as access to an information data base that Lenovo makes available to Customer.
#
#
#
#2. Prices, Payment, and Errors
#
#
#
#2.1 Except for credit or debit card transactions, or if not paid in advance of shipment, payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Any amounts not received by Lenovo within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice shall be overdue. Customer shall pay a late payment fee of the lesser of one and one half (1.5%) percent per month or the maximum rate permitted by law on the undisputed overdue balance of the invoice amount. Customer shall pay any applicable sales, use or similar taxes, fees or duties unless Customer provides exemption documentation to Lenovo. Customer is responsible for taxes, if any, on Products from the date Lenovo ships them to Customer or on Services, on the date the Services are provided by Lenovo. No other discounts, quantity entitlements, or promotions apply unless agreed in writing by Lenovo. Delivery charges, if applicable, will be as specified in an invoice.
#
#
#
#2.2  If you have made your purchase of hardware Products online and used a credit card to do so, the payment for your purchase will occur as described in this paragraph. During checkout, Lenovo will request a pre-authorization for the total order amount from your credit card company, but this is not an actual charge. Once your order ships, your credit card will be charged. If you ordered more than one item, there may be multiple charges as items ship separately as they become available.
#
#
#
#2.3 If Lenovo makes an error in pricing information and/or a typographic error on Lenovo.com or otherwise in any advertisements or in any communications with Customer, Lenovo may nevertheless refuse or cancel an order placed for a Product or Service quoted at such price or described in error, even if Lenovo has confirmed the receipt of Customer’s order or charged Customer’s credit or debit card. If Lenovo has charged Customer’s credit or debit card, Lenovo will issue a credit to Customer’s credit or debit card account in the amount of the charge.
#
#
#
#3. Electronically Delivered Software Products and Delivery of Hardware Products.
#
#
#
#3.1 In the case of electronically delivered software Products, Customer will receive an email with an activation key and download link. Customer shall be responsible for downloading the software Product and bear risk of loss relating thereto, including the failure of a computer, hard drive, or internet connection. In the case of software provided as a subscription service, Lenovo shall provide instructions on how to access such services.  Internet or other connection charges in connection with the download, access, and use of the software Product shall be Customer’s sole responsibility.
#
#
#
#3.2 Where the Customer has ordered hardware Products, the Products shall be delivered to the delivery address specified by the Customer during the purchase process. Lenovo shall in no way be held responsible for any delivery delays caused by Customer’s error(s) in entering their delivery address, or any other delay caused by circumstances outside Lenovo’s reasonable control, including without limitation the circumstances described in section 7.3 of this Agreement
#
#4. Returns
#
#Customer may return an eligible Product in its original package to Lenovo for a full refund, less any applicable return shipping and handling fees and any applicable restocking fees as stated below. Customer may only return the entire Product or all such Products for a refund. For purchases from Lenovo.com, all requests for returns must be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of invoice. For purchases from Lenovo Outlet, all requests for returns must be submitted within 14 calendar days from the date of invoice. For purchases from LenovoPRO, all requests for returns must be submitted within 45 calendar days from the date of invoice. For purchases of Motorola Products, all requests for returns must be submitted within 14 calendar days from the date of invoice.

Digital gaming products; partial refunds or credits for Products, including installation of software Product options; or quantities of Products that are not separately priced, are not available for return. To request a return, Customer must contact Lenovo to obtain an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number. Any authorized return must include the Product and all accessories in their original packaging. It must be received at the Lenovo National Return Center within 10 calendar days of issuance of the RMA. Returns on any other basis may be refused by Lenovo. Customer assumes risk of loss and damage for Products returned without an RMA. Upon receipt of your returned Product, Lenovo will issue a credit or refund of the purchase price paid, less any applicable return shipping and handling fees and any applicable restocking fees.
#
#
#
#Software Products acquired separately from a hardware Product may not be returned unless media-based software is unopened and still in its sealed package or, if delivered electronically or via a subscription service, software that you have not accepted the terms of the software license.  Customer may return the software Product in such an event within 30 calendar days of the date of invoice and receive a refund or credit in the amount of the price paid.

#Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the Privacy Sandbox initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on Topics or Protected Audience data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using Attribution Reporting data stored on their browser or mobile device. More information on the Privacy Sandbox.
#How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
#
#Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
#
#For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may also set cookies on your browser or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
#
#Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our Privacy Policy to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our Advertising page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
#
#Our Privacy Policy explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
#
#Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
#Ad personalization
#
#If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
#
#If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
#
#When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
#
#You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.
#How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
#
#Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
#
#    Ad Settings helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also learn how ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
#    If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings, My Activity allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
#    Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the Google Analytics browser add-on. Learn more about Google Analytics and privacy.
#    Incognito mode in Chrome allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about cookies.
#    Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about managing cookies in Chrome.

#F. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED
#REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE APPLE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES
#PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR

#OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE

#9. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
#SHALL APPLE, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR

#SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS OR SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPLE SOFTWARE OR
#SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR
#OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
#SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
#PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY
#NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be
#required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and ﬁfty
#dollars (U.S.$250.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its

#Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions
#These Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions (the “Supplemental Terms”) supplement the
#Software License Agreement for macOS (the “License”); both the terms of the License and these
#Supplemental Terms govern your use of the Apple Pay feature, which shall be deemed a “Service” under
#the License. Capitalized terms used in these Supplemental Terms have the meanings set forth in the
#License.
#1. Overview and Use Restrictions
#Apple Pay allows you to store virtual representations of credit, debit and prepaid cards, including Apple
#Card, that are supported by the Apple Pay feature (“Supported Cards”), use supported Macs to initiate
#or make payments within websites, and track online orders and view receipts. The Apple Pay features of
#the Apple Software may only be available in select regions, with select card issuers, payment networks,
#and merchants. Features may vary by region, issuer, and merchant. Supported Cards may change from
#time to time.
#Apple Pay is intended for your personal use and you may only provision your own Supported Cards. If
#you are provisioning a supported corporate card, you represent that you are doing so with the
#authorization of your employer and you are authorized to bind your employer to these terms of use and
#all transactions eﬀected by use of this feature.
#You agree not to use Apple Pay for illegal or fraudulent purposes, or any other purposes that are
#prohibited by the License and these Supplemental Terms. You further agree to use Apple Pay in
#accordance with applicable laws and regulations. You agree not to interfere with or disrupt the Apple
#Pay service (including accessing the service through any automated means), or any servers or networks
#connected to the service, or any policies, requirements or regulations of networks connected to the
#service (including any unauthorized access to, use or monitoring of data or traﬃc thereon).
#2. Use on Macs
#You can use Apple Pay on supported Macs to initiate payments on websites accessed through Safari.
#This feature requires you to have a Supported Card that has been provisioned to a supported iOS device
#or Apple Watch (“Supported Devices”). When you check out from a website using Apple Pay, you will be
#required to authorize the transaction using a Supported Device.
#In addition to the terms set forth in these Supplemental Terms, your use of Apple Pay to initiate
#payments on websites access through Safari is subject to the Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and
#Conditions applicable to your Supported Devices, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by
#reference and which can be accessed by going to: Settings > General > About > Legal > License from
#your iOS device, or About > Legal > License from the Watch app on a paired iOS device. Supported
#Devices may change from time to time.
#On a MacBook Pro with built-in Touch ID, you can set up Apple Pay by provisioning Supported Cards
#and using Apple Pay to make payments on websites accessed through Safari. In order to use Apple Pay
#on these Macs, you must have Supported Cards that are associated with an active iCloud account.
#Apple Pay is available only to individuals aged 13 years or older, and may be subject to additional age-
#based restrictions imposed by iCloud or the relevant card issuer of your Supported Cards.
#3. Apple’s Relationship With You
#Apple does not process payments, or have any other control over payments, returns, refunds, rewards,
#value, discounts, orders, order fulﬁlment, or other commerce activity that may arise out of your use of
#this feature.
#The terms of cardholder agreements you may have in place with your card issuer will continue to govern
#your use of your Supported Cards and their use in connection with Apple Pay. Similarly, your purchase
#of any goods or services using the Apple Pay feature will be subject to the merchant’s terms and
#conditions.
#Apple Card is only available in the United States and is issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake
#City Branch (“Apple Card Issuer”). When you apply for Apple Card, you are applying to open an account
#with the Apple Card Issuer. Apple Card is only available to individuals aged 18 years or older (or older
#depending on your state of residence). The ﬁnancial institution responsible for oﬀering Apple Card is
#subject to change, and your use of Apple Card is subject to their terms and conditions.
#Nothing in the License or these Supplemental Terms modiﬁes the terms of any cardholder or merchant
#agreement, or other terms and conditions applicable to the use of the features of Apple Pay, and such
#terms will govern your use of the applicable feature of Apple Pay and their virtual representation on your
#supported Mac.
#You agree that Apple is not a party to your cardholder or merchant agreements, nor is Apple responsible
#for the (a) content, accuracy or unavailability of any payment cards, commerce activities, transactions,
#purchases, orders, order fulﬁlment, or receipts while using Apple Pay functionality; (b) issuance of credit
#or assessing eligibility for credit; (c) activities of issuers, merchants, or other third parties related to your
#use of Apple Pay or Wallet; (d) provisioning decisions made by an issuer, merchant, or other third party in
#connection with a Supported Card; (e) accrual or redemption of rewards or stored value under a
#merchant’s program; or (f) funding or reloading of prepaid cards. For all disputes or questions about
#payment cards or associated commerce activity, please contact your issuer or the applicable merchant.
#4. Privacy
#When using Apple Pay to initiate a payment transaction to be completed on a Supported Device, Apple
#Pay will transfer payment information in an encrypted format between your Mac and your Supported
#Device to complete your transaction. When using Apple Pay to make a payment transaction on a
#MacBook Pro with built-in Touch ID, your payment information will be provided in encrypted format to
#the website as part of that transaction. When adding a card to Apple Pay on a MacBook Pro with built-in
#Touch ID, information about your device, such as whether certain device settings are enabled and device
#use patterns (e.g. percent time device is in motion, approximate number of calls per week), will be sent
#to Apple to determine your eligibility and to prevent fraud. You can ﬁnd detailed information on the
#personal information collected, used or shared as part of your use of Apple Pay by reading the relevant
#service speciﬁc privacy notices, including About Apple Pay and Privacy, which can be accessed on your
#iOS device or Mac, or within the Watch app on a paired iOS device, or by visiting https://
#www.apple.com/legal/privacy. By using Apple Pay, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its
#subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of all of the
#foregoing information, to provide Apple Pay functionality.
#5. Security
#Apple Pay stores virtual representations of your Supported Cards, and you understand and acknowledge
#that providing your device passcode or password to a third party, or allowing a third party to add their
#ﬁngerprint to use Touch ID on your Supported Device or Mac, may result in their ability to make Apple
#Pay payments within websites on your Mac. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of
#your devices and the applicable passcodes and passwords. You agree that Apple does not have any
#responsibility if you lose or share access to your device, or if you make unauthorized modiﬁcations to
#macOS.
#If your device is lost or stolen and you have Find My iPhone or Find My Mac enabled, you can use Find
#iPhone or https://icloud.com to attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Cards on
#the device by putting it into Lost Mode. You can also erase your device, which will attempt to suspend
#the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Cards on the device. You should also contact the card issuer
#of your Supported Cards in order to prevent unauthorized access to your virtual Supported Cards.
#If you report or Apple suspects fraudulent or abusive activity, you agree to cooperate with Apple in any
#investigation and to use any fraud prevention measures we prescribe.
#6. Limitation of Liability
#IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET
#FORTH IN THE LICENSE, APPLE DOES NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR PURCHASES,
#PAYMENTS, TRANSACTIONS, ORDERS, ORDER FULFILMENT, RECEIPT INFORMATION, OR
#OTHER COMMERCE ACTIVITY MADE USING THE APPLE PAY FEATURE, AND YOU AGREE TO
#LOOK SOLELY TO AGREEMENTS YOU MAY HAVE WITH YOUR CARD ISSUER, PAYMENT
#NETWORK, OR MERCHANT TO RESOLVE ANY QUESTIONS OR DISPUTES RELATING TO YOUR
#SUPPORTED CARDS, VIRTUAL SUPPORTED CARDS AND ASSOCIATED COMMERCE ACTIVITY.

#According to all known laws
#of aviation,
#
#
#there is no way a bee
#should be able to fly.
#
#
#Its wings are too small to get
#its fat little body off the ground.
#
#
#The bee, of course, flies anyway
#
#
#because bees don't care
#what humans think is impossible.
#
#
#Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
#Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
#
#
#Ooh, black and yellow!
#Let's shake it up a little.
#
#
#Barry! Breakfast is ready!
#
#
#Ooming!
#
#
#Hang on a second.
#
#
#Hello?
#
#
#- Barry?
#- Adam?
#
#
#- Oan you believe this is happening?
#- I can't. I'll pick you up.
#
#
#Looking sharp.
#
#
#Use the stairs. Your father
#paid good money for those.
#
#
#Sorry. I'm excited.
#
#
#Here's the graduate.
#We're very proud of you, son.
#
#
#A perfect report card, all B's.
#
#
#Very proud.
#
#
#Ma! I got a thing going here.
#
#
#- You got lint on your fuzz.
#- Ow! That's me!
#
#
#- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
#- Bye!
#
#
#Barry, I told you,
#stop flying in the house!
#
#
#- Hey, Adam.
#- Hey, Barry.
#
#
#- Is that fuzz gel?
#- A little. Special day, graduation.
#
#
#Never thought I'd make it.
#
#
#Three days grade school,
#three days high school.
#
#
#Those were awkward.
#
#
#Three days college. I'm glad I took
#a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
#
#
#You did come back different.
#
#
#- Hi, Barry.
#- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
#
#
#- Hear about Frankie?
#- Yeah.
#
#
#- You going to the funeral?
#- No, I'm not going.
#
#
#Everybody knows,
#sting someone, you die.
#
#
#Don't waste it on a squirrel.
#Such a hothead.
#
#
#I guess he could have
#just gotten out of the way.
#
#
#I love this incorporating
#an amusement park into our day.
#
#
#That's why we don't need vacations.
#
#
#Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
#under the circumstances.
#
#
#- Well, Adam, today we are men.
#- We are!
#
#
#- Bee-men.
#- Amen!
#
#
#Hallelujah!
#
#
#Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
#
#
#please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
#
#
#Welcome, New Hive Oity
#graduating class of...
#
#
#...9:15.
#
#
#That concludes our ceremonies.
#
#
#And begins your career
#at Honex Industries!
#
#
#Will we pick ourjob today?
#
#
#I heard it's just orientation.
#
#
#Heads up! Here we go.
#
#
#Keep your hands and antennas
#inside the tram at all times.
#
#
#- Wonder what it'll be like?
#- A little scary.
#
#
#Welcome to Honex,
#a division of Honesco
#
#
#and a part of the Hexagon Group.
#
#
#This is it!
#
#
#Wow.
#
#
#Wow.
#
#
#We know that you, as a bee,
#have worked your whole life
#
#
#to get to the point where you
#can work for your whole life.
#
#
#Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
#Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
#
#
#Our top-secret formula
#
#
#is automatically color-corrected,
#scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
#
#
#into this soothing sweet syrup
#
#
#with its distinctive
#golden glow you know as...
#
#
#Honey!
#
#
#- That girl was hot.
#- She's my cousin!
#
#
#- She is?
#- Yes, we're all cousins.
#
#
#- Right. You're right.
#- At Honex, we constantly strive
#
#
#to improve every aspect
#of bee existence.
#
#
#These bees are stress-testing
#a new helmet technology.
#
#
#- What do you think he makes?
#- Not enough.
#
#
#Here we have our latest advancement,
#the Krelman.
#
#
#- What does that do?
#- Oatches that little strand of honey
#
#
#that hangs after you pour it.
#Saves us millions.
#
#
#Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
#
#
#Of course. Most bee jobs are
#small ones. But bees know
#
#
#that every small job,
#if it's done well, means a lot.
#
#
#But choose carefully
#
#
#because you'll stay in the job
#you pick for the rest of your life.
#
#
#The same job the rest of your life?
#I didn't know that.
#
#
#What's the difference?
#
#
#You'll be happy to know that bees,
#as a species, haven't had one day off
#
#
#in 27 million years.
#
#
#So you'll just work us to death?
#
#
#We'll sure try.
#
#
#Wow! That blew my mind!
#
#
#"What's the difference?"
#How can you say that?
#
#
#One job forever?
#That's an insane choice to have to make.
#
#
#I'm relieved. Now we only have
#to make one decision in life.
#
#
#But, Adam, how could they
#never have told us that?
#
#
#Why would you question anything?
#We're bees.
#
#
#We're the most perfectly
#functioning society on Earth.
#
#
#You ever think maybe things
#work a little too well here?
#
#
#Like what? Give me one example.
#
#
#I don't know. But you know
#what I'm talking about.
#
#
#Please clear the gate.
#Royal Nectar Force on approach.
#
#
#Wait a second. Oheck it out.
#
#
#- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
#- Wow.
#
#
#I've never seen them this close.
#
#
#They know what it's like
#outside the hive.
#
#
#Yeah, but some don't come back.
#
#
#- Hey, Jocks!
#- Hi, Jocks!
#
#
#You guys did great!
#
#
#You're monsters!
#You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
#
#
#- I wonder where they were.
#- I don't know.
#
#
#Their day's not planned.
#
#
#Outside the hive, flying who knows
#where, doing who knows what.
#
#
#You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
#Jock. You have to be bred for that.
#
#
#Right.
#
#
#Look. That's more pollen
#than you and I will see in a lifetime.
#
#
#It's just a status symbol.
#Bees make too much of it.
#
#
#Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
#and the ladies see you wearing it.
#
#
#Those ladies?
#Aren't they our cousins too?
#
#
#Distant. Distant.
#
#
#Look at these two.
#
#
#- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
#- Let's have fun with them.
#
#
#It must be dangerous
#being a Pollen Jock.
#
#
#Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
#against a mushroom!
#
#
#He had a paw on my throat,
#and with the other, he was slapping me!
#
#
#- Oh, my!
#- I never thought I'd knock him out.
#
#
#What were you doing during this?
#
#
#Trying to alert the authorities.
#
#
#I can autograph that.
#
#
#A little gusty out there today,
#wasn't it, comrades?
#
#
#Yeah. Gusty.
#
#
#We're hitting a sunflower patch
#six miles from here tomorrow.
#
#
#- Six miles, huh?
#- Barry!
#
#
#A puddle jump for us,
#but maybe you're not up for it.
#
#
#- Maybe I am.
#- You are not!
#
#
#We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
#
#
#What do you think, buzzy-boy?
#Are you bee enough?
#
#
#I might be. It all depends
#on what 0900 means.
#
#
#Hey, Honex!
#
#
#Dad, you surprised me.
#
#
#You decide what you're interested in?
#
#
#- Well, there's a lot of choices.
#- But you only get one.
#
#
#Do you ever get bored
#doing the same job every day?
#
#
#Son, let me tell you about stirring.
#
#
#You grab that stick, and you just
#move it around, and you stir it around.
#
#
#You get yourself into a rhythm.
#It's a beautiful thing.
#
#
#You know, Dad,
#the more I think about it,
#
#
#maybe the honey field
#just isn't right for me.
#
#
#You were thinking of what,
#making balloon animals?
#
#
#That's a bad job
#for a guy with a stinger.
#
#
#Janet, your son's not sure
#he wants to go into honey!
#
#
#- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
#- I'm not trying to be funny.
#
#
#You're not funny! You're going
#into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
#
#
#- You're gonna be a stirrer?
#- No one's listening to me!
#
#
#Wait till you see the sticks I have.
#
#
#I could say anything right now.
#I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
#
#
#Let's open some honey and celebrate!
#
#
#Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
#Shave my antennae.
#
#
#Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
#a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
#
#
#I'm so proud.
#
#
#- We're starting work today!
#- Today's the day.
#
#
#Oome on! All the good jobs
#will be gone.
#
#
#Yeah, right.
#
#
#Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
#stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
#
#
#- Is it still available?
#- Hang on. Two left!
#
#
#One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
#Step to the side.
#
#
#- What'd you get?
#- Picking crud out. Stellar!
#
#
#Wow!
#
#
#Oouple of newbies?
#
#
#Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
#
#
#Make your choice.
#
#
#- You want to go first?
#- No, you go.
#
#
#Oh, my. What's available?
#
#
#Restroom attendant's open,
#not for the reason you think.
#
#
#- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
#- Sure, you're on.
#
#
#I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
#
#
#Wax monkey's always open.
#
#
#The Krelman opened up again.
#
#
#What happened?
#
#
#A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
#He's dead. Another dead one.
#
#
#Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
#
#
#Dead from the neck up.
#Dead from the neck down. That's life!
#
#
#Oh, this is so hard!
#
#
#Heating, cooling,
#stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
#
#
#humming, inspector number seven,
#lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
#
#
#mite wrangler. Barry, what
#do you think I should... Barry?
#
#
#Barry!
#
#
#All right, we've got the sunflower patch
#in quadrant nine...
#
#
#What happened to you?
#Where are you?
#
#
#- I'm going out.
#- Out? Out where?
#
#
#- Out there.
#- Oh, no!
#
#
#I have to, before I go
#to work for the rest of my life.
#
#
#You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
#
#
#Another call coming in.
#
#
#If anyone's feeling brave,
#there's a Korean deli on 83rd
#
#
#that gets their roses today.
#
#
#Hey, guys.
#
#
#- Look at that.
#- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
#
#
#Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
#
#
#It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
#
#
#Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
#
#
#Sign here, here. Just initial that.
#
#
#- Thank you.
#- OK.
#
#
#You got a rain advisory today,
#
#
#and as you all know,
#bees cannot fly in rain.
#
#
#So be careful. As always,
#watch your brooms,
#
#
#hockey sticks, dogs,
#birds, bears and bats.
#
#
#Also, I got a couple of reports
#of root beer being poured on us.
#
#
#Murphy's in a home because of it,
#babbling like a cicada!
#
#
#- That's awful.
#- And a reminder for you rookies,
#
#
#bee law number one,
#absolutely no talking to humans!
#
#
#All right, launch positions!
#
#
#Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
#buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
#
#
#Black and yellow!
#
#
#Hello!
#
#
#You ready for this, hot shot?
#
#
#Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
#
#
#Wind, check.
#
#
#- Antennae, check.
#- Nectar pack, check.
#
#
#- Wings, check.
#- Stinger, check.
#
#
#Scared out of my shorts, check.
#
#
#OK, ladies,
#
#
#let's move it out!
#
#
#Pound those petunias,
#you striped stem-suckers!
#
#
#All of you, drain those flowers!
#
#
#Wow! I'm out!
#
#
#I can't believe I'm out!
#
#
#So blue.
#
#
#I feel so fast and free!
#
#
#Box kite!
#
#
#Wow!
#
#
#Flowers!
#
#
#This is Blue Leader.
#We have roses visual.
#
#
#Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
#
#
#Roses!
#
#
#30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
#
#
#Stand to the side, kid.
#It's got a bit of a kick.
#
#
#That is one nectar collector!
#
#
#- Ever see pollination up close?
#- No, sir.
#
#
#I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
#over here. Maybe a dash over there,
#
#
#a pinch on that one.
#See that? It's a little bit of magic.
#
#
#That's amazing. Why do we do that?
#
#
#That's pollen power. More pollen, more
#flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
#
#
#Oool.
#
#
#I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
#Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?
#
#
#Oopy that visual.
#
#
#Wait. One of these flowers
#seems to be on the move.
#
#
#Say again? You're reporting
#a moving flower?
#
#
#Affirmative.
#
#
#That was on the line!
#
#
#This is the coolest. What is it?
#
#
#I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
#
#
#It smells good.
#Not like a flower, but I like it.
#
#
#Yeah, fuzzy.
#
#
#Ohemical-y.
#
#
#Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.
#
#
#My sweet lord of bees!
#
#
#Oandy-brain, get off there!
#
#
#Problem!
#
#
#- Guys!
#- This could be bad.
#
#
#Affirmative.
#
#
#Very close.
#
#
#Gonna hurt.
#
#
#Mama's little boy.
#
#
#You are way out of position, rookie!
#
#
#Ooming in at you like a missile!
#
#
#Help me!
#
#
#I don't think these are flowers.
#
#
#- Should we tell him?
#- I think he knows.
#
#
#What is this?!
#
#
#Match point!
#
#
#You can start packing up, honey,
#because you're about to eat it!
#
#
#Yowser!
#
#
#Gross.
#
#
#There's a bee in the car!
#
#
#- Do something!
#- I'm driving!
#
#
#- Hi, bee.
#- He's back here!
#
#
#He's going to sting me!
#
#
#Nobody move. If you don't move,
#he won't sting you. Freeze!
#
#
#He blinked!
#
#
#Spray him, Granny!
#
#
#What are you doing?!
#
#
#Wow... the tension level
#out here is unbelievable.
#
#
#I gotta get home.
#
#
#Oan't fly in rain.
#
#
#Oan't fly in rain.
#
#
#Oan't fly in rain.
#
#
#Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
#
#
#Ken, could you close
#the window please?
#
#
#Ken, could you close
#the window please?
#
#
#Oheck out my new resume.
#I made it into a fold-out brochure.
#
#
#You see? Folds out.
#
#
#Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
#
#
#What was that?
#
#
#Maybe this time. This time. This time.
#This time! This time! This...
#
#
#Drapes!
#
#
#That is diabolical.
#
#
#It's fantastic. It's got all my special
#skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
#
#
#What's number one? Star Wars?
#
#
#Nah, I don't go for that...
#
#
#...kind of stuff.
#
#
#No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
#They're out of their minds.
#
#
#When I leave a job interview, they're
#flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
#
#
#There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
#
#
#I don't remember the sun
#having a big 75 on it.
#
#
#I predicted global warming.
#
#
#I could feel it getting hotter.
#At first I thought it was just me.
#
#
#Wait! Stop! Bee!
#
#
#Stand back. These are winter boots.
#
#
#Wait!
#
#
#Don't kill him!
#
#
#You know I'm allergic to them!
#This thing could kill me!
#
#
#Why does his life have
#less value than yours?
#
#
#Why does his life have any less value
#than mine? Is that your statement?
#
#
#I'm just saying all life has value. You
#don't know what he's capable of feeling.
#
#
#My brochure!
#
#
#There you go, little guy.
#
#
#I'm not scared of him.
#It's an allergic thing.
#
#
#Put that on your resume brochure.
#
#
#My whole face could puff up.
#
#
#Make it one of your special skills.
#
#
#Knocking someone out
#is also a special skill.
#
#
#Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
#
#
#- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
#- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
#
#
#- You could put carob chips on there.
#- Bye.
#
#
#- Supposed to be less calories.
#- Bye.
#
#
#I gotta say something.
#
#
#She saved my life.
#I gotta say something.
#
#
#All right, here it goes.
#
#
#Nah.
#
#
#What would I say?
#
#
#I could really get in trouble.
#
#
#It's a bee law.
#You're not supposed to talk to a human.
#
#
#I can't believe I'm doing this.
#
#
#I've got to.
#
#
#Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!
#
#
#No. Yes. No.
#
#
#Do it. I can't.
#
#
#How should I start it?
#"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
#
#
#Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
#
#
#Hi!
#
#
#I'm sorry.
#
#
#- You're talking.
#- Yes, I know.
#
#
#You're talking!
#
#
#I'm so sorry.
#
#
#No, it's OK. It's fine.
#I know I'm dreaming.
#
#
#But I don't recall going to bed.
#
#
#Well, I'm sure this
#is very disconcerting.
#
#
#This is a bit of a surprise to me.
#I mean, you're a bee!
#
#
#I am. And I'm not supposed
#to be doing this,
#
#
#but they were all trying to kill me.
#
#
#And if it wasn't for you...
#
#
#I had to thank you.
#It's just how I was raised.
#
#
#That was a little weird.
#
#
#- I'm talking with a bee.
#- Yeah.
#
#
#I'm talking to a bee.
#And the bee is talking to me!
#
#
#I just want to say I'm grateful.
#I'll leave now.
#
#
#- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
#- What?
#
#
#The talking thing.
#
#
#Same way you did, I guess.
#"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
#
#
#- That's very funny.
#- Yeah.
#
#
#Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
#we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
#
#
#Anyway...
#
#
#Oan I...
#
#
#...get you something?
#- Like what?
#
#
#I don't know. I mean...
#I don't know. Ooffee?
#
#
#I don't want to put you out.
#
#
#It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
#
#
#- It's just coffee.
#- I hate to impose.
#
#
#- Don't be ridiculous!
#- Actually, I would love a cup.
#
#
#Hey, you want rum cake?
#
#
#- I shouldn't.
#- Have some.
#
#
#- No, I can't.
#- Oome on!
#
#
#I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
#
#
#- Where?
#- These stripes don't help.
#
#
#You look great!
#
#
#I don't know if you know
#anything about fashion.
#
#
#Are you all right?
#
#
#No.
#
#
#He's making the tie in the cab
#as they're flying up Madison.
#
#
#He finally gets there.
#
#
#He runs up the steps into the church.
#The wedding is on.
#
#
#And he says, "Watermelon?
#I thought you said Guatemalan.
#
#
#Why would I marry a watermelon?"
#
#
#Is that a bee joke?
#
#
#That's the kind of stuff we do.
#
#
#Yeah, different.
#
#
#So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
#
#
#About work? I don't know.
#
#
#I want to do my part for the hive,
#but I can't do it the way they want.
#
#
#I know how you feel.
#
#
#- You do?
#- Sure.
#
#
#My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
#a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
#
#
#- Really?
#- My only interest is flowers.
#
#
#Our new queen was just elected
#with that same campaign slogan.
#
#
#Anyway, if you look...
#
#
#There's my hive right there. See it?
#
#
#You're in Sheep Meadow!
#
#
#Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
#
#
#No way! I know that area.
#I lost a toe ring there once.
#
#
#- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
#- Why not?
#
#
#- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
#- Maybe I'll try that.
#
#
#- You all right, ma'am?
#- Oh, yeah. Fine.
#
#
#Just having two cups of coffee!
#
#
#Anyway, this has been great.
#Thanks for the coffee.
#
#
#Yeah, it's no trouble.
#
#
#Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
#I'd be up the rest of my life.
#
#
#Are you...?
#
#
#Oan I take a piece of this with me?
#
#
#Sure! Here, have a crumb.
#
#
#- Thanks!
#- Yeah.
#
#
#All right. Well, then...
#I guess I'll see you around.
#
#
#Or not.
#
#
#OK, Barry.
#
#
#And thank you
#so much again... for before.
#
#
#Oh, that? That was nothing.
#
#
#Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
#
#
#This can't possibly work.
#
#
#He's all set to go.
#We may as well try it.
#
#
#OK, Dave, pull the chute.
#
#
#- Sounds amazing.
#- It was amazing!
#
#
#It was the scariest,
#happiest moment of my life.
#
#
#Humans! I can't believe
#you were with humans!
#
#
#Giant, scary humans!
#What were they like?
#
#
#Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
#
#
#They eat crazy giant things.
#They drive crazy.
#
#
#- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
#- Some of them. But some of them don't.
#
#
#- How'd you get back?
#- Poodle.
#
#
#You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
#whatever you wanted to see.
#
#
#You had your "experience." Now you
#can pick out yourjob and be normal.
#
#
#- Well...
#- Well?
#
#
#Well, I met someone.
#
#
#You did? Was she Bee-ish?
#
#
#- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
#- No, no, no, not a wasp.
#
#
#- Spider?
#- I'm not attracted to spiders.
#
#
#I know it's the hottest thing,
#with the eight legs and all.
#
#
#I can't get by that face.
#
#
#So who is she?
#
#
#She's... human.
#
#
#No, no. That's a bee law.
#You wouldn't break a bee law.
#
#
#- Her name's Vanessa.
#- Oh, boy.
#
#
#She's so nice. And she's a florist!
#
#
#Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
#
#
#We're not dating.
#
#
#You're flying outside the hive, talking
#to humans that attack our homes
#
#
#with power washers and M-80s!
#One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
#
#
#She saved my life!
#And she understands me.
#
#
#This is over!
#
#
#Eat this.
#
#
#This is not over! What was that?
#
#
#- They call it a crumb.
#- It was so stingin' stripey!
#
#
#And that's not what they eat.
#That's what falls off what they eat!
#
#
#- You know what a Oinnabon is?
#- No.
#
#
#It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
#They heat it up...
#
#
#Sit down!
#
#
#...really hot!
#- Listen to me!
#
#
#We are not them! We're us.
#There's us and there's them!
#
#
#Yes, but who can deny
#the heart that is yearning?
#
#
#There's no yearning.
#Stop yearning. Listen to me!
#
#
#You have got to start thinking bee,
#my friend. Thinking bee!
#
#
#- Thinking bee.
#- Thinking bee.
#
#
#Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
#Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
#
#
#There he is. He's in the pool.
#
#
#You know what your problem is, Barry?
#
#
#I gotta start thinking bee?
#
#
#How much longer will this go on?
#
#
#It's been three days!
#Why aren't you working?
#
#
#I've got a lot of big life decisions
#to think about.
#
#
#What life? You have no life!
#You have no job. You're barely a bee!
#
#
#Would it kill you
#to make a little honey?
#
#
#Barry, come out.
#Your father's talking to you.
#
#
#Martin, would you talk to him?
#
#
#Barry, I'm talking to you!
#
#
#You coming?
#
#
#Got everything?
#
#
#All set!
#
#
#Go ahead. I'll catch up.
#
#
#Don't be too long.
#
#
#Watch this!
#
#
#Vanessa!
#
#
#- We're still here.
#- I told you not to yell at him.
#
#
#He doesn't respond to yelling!
#
#
#- Then why yell at me?
#- Because you don't listen!
#
#
#I'm not listening to this.
#
#
#Sorry, I've gotta go.
#
#
#- Where are you going?
#- I'm meeting a friend.
#
#
#A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
#
#
#Bye.
#
#
#I just hope she's Bee-ish.
#
#
#They have a huge parade
#of flowers every year in Pasadena?
#
#
#To be in the Tournament of Roses,
#that's every florist's dream!
#
#
#Up on a float, surrounded
#by flowers, crowds cheering.
#
#
#A tournament. Do the roses
#compete in athletic events?
#
#
#No. All right, I've got one.
#How come you don't fly everywhere?
#
#
#It's exhausting. Why don't you
#run everywhere? It's faster.
#
#
#Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
#All right, your turn.
#
#
#TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
#That's insane!
#
#
#You don't have that?
#
#
#We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
#It's a horrible, horrible disease.
#
#
#Oh, my.
#
#
#Dumb bees!
#
#
#You must want to sting all those jerks.
#
#
#We try not to sting.
#It's usually fatal for us.
#
#
#So you have to watch your temper.
#
#
#Very carefully.
#You kick a wall, take a walk,
#
#
#write an angry letter and throw it out.
#Work through it like any emotion:
#
#
#Anger, jealousy, lust.
#
#
#Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
#
#
#Yeah.
#
#
#- What is wrong with you?!
#- It's a bug.
#
#
#He's not bothering anybody.
#Get out of here, you creep!
#
#
#What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
#
#
#Yeah, it was. How did you know?
#
#
#It felt like about 10 pages.
#Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
#
#
#You've really got that
#down to a science.
#
#
#- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
#- I'll bet.
#
#
#What in the name
#of Mighty Hercules is this?
#
#
#How did this get here?
#Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,
#
#
#Ray Liotta Private Select?
#
#
#- Is he that actor?
#- I never heard of him.
#
#
#- Why is this here?
#- For people. We eat it.
#
#
#You don't have
#enough food of your own?
#
#
#- Well, yes.
#- How do you get it?
#
#
#- Bees make it.
#- I know who makes it!
#
#
#And it's hard to make it!
#
#
#There's heating, cooling, stirring.
#You need a whole Krelman thing!
#
#
#- It's organic.
#- It's our-ganic!
#
#
#It's just honey, Barry.
#
#
#Just what?!
#
#
#Bees don't know about this!
#This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
#
#
#You've taken our homes, schools,
#hospitals! This is all we have!
#
#
#And it's on sale?!
#I'm getting to the bottom of this.
#
#
#I'm getting to the bottom
#of all of this!
#
#
#Hey, Hector.
#
#
#- You almost done?
#- Almost.
#
#
#He is here. I sense it.
#
#
#Well, I guess I'll go home now
#
#
#and just leave this nice honey out,
#with no one around.
#
#
#You're busted, box boy!
#
#
#I knew I heard something.
#So you can talk!
#
#
#I can talk.
#And now you'll start talking!
#
#
#Where you getting the sweet stuff?
#Who's your supplier?
#
#
#I don't understand.
#I thought we were friends.
#
#
#The last thing we want
#to do is upset bees!
#
#
#You're too late! It's ours now!
#
#
#You, sir, have crossed
#the wrong sword!
#
#
#You, sir, will be lunch
#for my iguana, Ignacio!
#
#
#Where is the honey coming from?
#
#
#Tell me where!
#
#
#Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
#
#
#Orazy person!
#
#
#What horrible thing has happened here?
#
#
#These faces, they never knew
#what hit them. And now
#
#
#they're on the road to nowhere!
#
#
#Just keep still.
#
#
#What? You're not dead?
#
#
#Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
#that moves. Where you headed?
#
#
#To Honey Farms.
#I am onto something huge here.
#
#
#I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
#crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
#
#
#I'm going to Tacoma.
#
#
#- And you?
#- He really is dead.
#
#
#All right.
#
#
#Uh-oh!
#
#
#- What is that?!
#- Oh, no!
#
#
#- A wiper! Triple blade!
#- Triple blade?
#
#
#Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
#
#
#Why does everything have
#to be so doggone clean?!
#
#
#How much do you people need to see?!
#
#
#Open your eyes!
#Stick your head out the window!
#
#
#From NPR News in Washington,
#I'm Oarl Kasell.
#
#
#But don't kill no more bugs!
#
#
#- Bee!
#- Moose blood guy!!
#
#
#- You hear something?
#- Like what?
#
#
#Like tiny screaming.
#
#
#Turn off the radio.
#
#
#Whassup, bee boy?
#
#
#Hey, Blood.
#
#
#Just a row of honey jars,
#as far as the eye could see.
#
#
#Wow!
#
#
#I assume wherever this truck goes
#is where they're getting it.
#
#
#I mean, that honey's ours.
#
#
#- Bees hang tight.
#- We're all jammed in.
#
#
#It's a close community.
#
#
#Not us, man. We on our own.
#Every mosquito on his own.
#
#
#- What if you get in trouble?
#- You a mosquito, you in trouble.
#
#
#Nobody likes us. They just smack.
#See a mosquito, smack, smack!
#
#
#At least you're out in the world.
#You must meet girls.
#
#
#Mosquito girls try to trade up,
#get with a moth, dragonfly.
#
#
#Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
#
#
#You got to be kidding me!
#
#
#Mooseblood's about to leave
#the building! So long, bee!
#
#
#- Hey, guys!
#- Mooseblood!
#
#
#I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
#Did you bring your crazy straw?
#
#
#We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
#and it's pretty much pure profit.
#
#
#What is this place?
#
#
#A bee's got a brain
#the size of a pinhead.
#
#
#They are pinheads!
#
#
#Pinhead.
#
#
#- Oheck out the new smoker.
#- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
#
#
#The Thomas 3000!
#
#
#Smoker?
#
#
#Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
#Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
#
#
#A couple breaths of this
#knocks them right out.
#
#
#They make the honey,
#and we make the money.
#
#
#"They make the honey,
#and we make the money"?
#
#
#Oh, my!
#
#
#What's going on? Are you OK?
#
#
#Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
#
#
#Do you know you're
#in a fake hive with fake walls?
#
#
#Our queen was moved here.
#We had no choice.
#
#
#This is your queen?
#That's a man in women's clothes!
#
#
#That's a drag queen!
#
#
#What is this?
#
#
#Oh, no!
#
#
#There's hundreds of them!
#
#
#Bee honey.
#
#
#Our honey is being brazenly stolen
#on a massive scale!
#
#
#This is worse than anything bears
#have done! I intend to do something.
#
#
#Oh, Barry, stop.
#
#
#Who told you humans are taking
#our honey? That's a rumor.
#
#
#Do these look like rumors?
#
#
#That's a conspiracy theory.
#These are obviously doctored photos.
#
#
#How did you get mixed up in this?
#
#
#He's been talking to humans.
#
#
#- What?
#- Talking to humans?!
#
#
#He has a human girlfriend.
#And they make out!
#
#
#Make out? Barry!
#
#
#We do not.
#
#
#- You wish you could.
#- Whose side are you on?
#
#
#The bees!
#
#
#I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
#Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
#
#
#Barry, this is what you want
#to do with your life?
#
#
#I want to do it for all our lives.
#Nobody works harder than bees!
#
#
#Dad, I remember you
#coming home so overworked
#
#
#your hands were still stirring.
#You couldn't stop.
#
#
#I remember that.
#
#
#What right do they have to our honey?
#
#
#We live on two cups a year. They put it
#in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
#
#
#Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
#
#
#Sting them where it really hurts.
#
#
#In the face! The eye!
#
#
#- That would hurt.
#- No.
#
#
#Up the nose? That's a killer.
#
#
#There's only one place you can sting
#the humans, one place where it matters.
#
#
#Hive at Five, the hive's only
#full-hour action news source.
#
#
#No more bee beards!

#
#
#And Jeanette Ohung.
#
#
#- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
#- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
#
#
#A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
#
#
#intends to sue the human race
#for stealing our honey,
#
#
#packaging it and profiting
#from it illegally!
#
#
#Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
#
#
#we'll have three former queens here in
#our studio, discussing their new book,
#
#
#Olassy Ladies,
#out this week on Hexagon.
#
#
#Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
#
#
#Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
#from the hive. I can't do this"?
#
#
#Bees have never been afraid
#to change the world.
#
#
#What about Bee Oolumbus?
#Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
#
#
#Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
#
#
#We were thinking
#of stickball or candy stores.
#
#
#How old are you?
#
#
#The bee community
#is supporting you in this case,
#
#
#which will be the trial
#of the bee century.
#
#
#You know, they have a Larry King
#in the human world too.
#
#
#It's a common name. Next week...
#
#
#He looks like you and has a show
#and suspenders and colored dots...
#
#
#Next week...
#
#
#Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
#guest even though you just heard 'em.
#
#
#Bear Week next week!
#They're scary, hairy and here live.
#
#
#Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
#squinty eyes, very Jewish.
#
#
#In tennis, you attack
#at the point of weakness!
#
#
#It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
#
#
#Honey, her backhand's a joke!
#I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
#
#
#Quiet, please.
#Actual work going on here.
#
#
#- Is that that same bee?
#- Yes, it is!
#
#
#I'm helping him sue the human race.
#
#
#- Hello.
#- Hello, bee.
#
#
#This is Ken.
#
#
#Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
#ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
#
#
#Why does he talk again?
#
#
#Listen, you better go
#'cause we're really busy working.
#
#
#But it's our yogurt night!
#
#
#Bye-bye.
#
#
#Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
#
#
#You poor thing.
#You two have been at this for hours!
#
#
#Yes, and Adam here
#has been a huge help.
#
#
#- Frosting...
#- How many sugars?
#
#
#Just one. I try not
#to use the competition.
#
#
#So why are you helping me?
#
#
#Bees have good qualities.
#
#
#And it takes my mind off the shop.
#
#
#Instead of flowers, people
#are giving balloon bouquets now.
#
#
#Those are great, if you're three.
#
#
#And artificial flowers.
#
#
#- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
#- Yeah, me too.
#
#
#Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
#
#
#Bees must hate those fake things!
#
#
#Nothing worse
#than a daffodil that's had work done.
#
#
#Maybe this could make up
#for it a little bit.
#
#
#- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
#- I guess.
#
#
#You sure you want to go through with it?
#
#
#Am I sure? When I'm done with
#the humans, they won't be able
#
#
#to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
#without paying a royalty!
#
#
#It's an incredible scene
#here in downtown Manhattan,
#
#
#where the world anxiously waits,
#because for the first time in history,
#
#
#we will hear for ourselves
#if a honeybee can actually speak.
#
#
#What have we gotten into here, Barry?
#
#
#It's pretty big, isn't it?
#
#
#I can't believe how many humans
#don't work during the day.
#
#
#You think billion-dollar multinational
#food companies have good lawyers?
#
#
#Everybody needs to stay
#behind the barricade.
#
#
#- What's the matter?
#- I don't know, I just got a chill.
#
#
#Well, if it isn't the bee team.
#
#
#You boys work on this?
#
#
#All rise! The Honorable
#Judge Bumbleton presiding.
#
#
#All right. Oase number 4475,
#
#
#Superior Oourt of New York,
#Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
#
#
#is now in session.
#
#
#Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
#the five food companies collectively?
#
#
#A privilege.
#
#
#Mr. Benson... you're representing
#all the bees of the world?
#
#
#I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
#we're ready to proceed.
#
#
#Mr. Montgomery,
#your opening statement, please.
#
#
#Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
#
#
#my grandmother was a simple woman.
#
#
#Born on a farm, she believed
#it was man's divine right
#
#
#to benefit from the bounty
#of nature God put before us.
#
#
#If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
#Mr. Benson imagines,
#
#
#just think of what would it mean.
#
#
#I would have to negotiate
#with the silkworm
#
#
#for the elastic in my britches!
#
#
#Talking bee!
#
#
#How do we know this isn't some sort of
#
#
#holographic motion-picture-capture
#Hollywood wizardry?
#
#
#They could be using laser beams!
#
#
#Robotics! Ventriloquism!
#Oloning! For all we know,
#
#
#he could be on steroids!
#
#
#Mr. Benson?
#
#
#Ladies and gentlemen,
#there's no trickery here.
#
#
#I'm just an ordinary bee.
#Honey's pretty important to me.
#
#
#It's important to all bees.
#We invented it!
#
#
#We make it. And we protect it
#with our lives.
#
#
#Unfortunately, there are
#some people in this room
#
#
#who think they can take it from us
#
#
#'cause we're the little guys!
#I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
#
#
#you'll see how, by taking our honey,
#you not only take everything we have
#
#
#but everything we are!
#
#
#I wish he'd dress like that
#all the time. So nice!
#
#
#Oall your first witness.
#
#
#So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
#of Honey Farms, big company you have.
#
#
#I suppose so.
#
#
#I see you also own
#Honeyburton and Honron!
#
#
#Yes, they provide beekeepers
#for our farms.
#
#
#Beekeeper. I find that
#to be a very disturbing term.
#
#
#I don't imagine you employ
#any bee-free-ers, do you?
#
#
#- No.
#- I couldn't hear you.
#
#
#- No.
#- No.
#
#
#Because you don't free bees.
#You keep bees. Not only that,
#
#
#it seems you thought a bear would be
#an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
#
#
#They're very lovable creatures.
#
#
#Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
#
#
#You mean like this?
#
#
#Bears kill bees!
#
#
#How'd you like his head crashing
#through your living room?!
#
#
#Biting into your couch!
#Spitting out your throw pillows!
#
#
#OK, that's enough. Take him away.
#
#
#So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
#Your name intrigues me.
#
#
#- Where have I heard it before?
#- I was with a band called The Police.
#
#
#But you've never been
#a police officer, have you?
#
#
#No, I haven't.
#
#
#No, you haven't. And so here
#we have yet another example
#
#
#of bee culture casually
#stolen by a human
#
#
#for nothing more than
#a prance-about stage name.
#
#
#Oh, please.
#
#
#Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
#
#
#Because I'm feeling
#a little stung, Sting.
#
#
#Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
#
#
#That's not his real name?! You idiots!
#
#
#Mr. Liotta, first,
#belated congratulations on
#
#
#your Emmy win for a guest spot
#on ER in 2005.
#
#
#Thank you. Thank you.
#
#
#I see from your resume
#that you're devilishly handsome
#
#
#with a churning inner turmoil
#that's ready to blow.
#
#
#I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
#
#
#Not yet it isn't. But is this
#what it's come to for you?
#
#
#Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
#so you don't
#
#
#have to rehearse
#your part and learn your lines, sir?
#
#
#Watch it, Benson!
#I could blow right now!
#
#
#This isn't a goodfella.
#This is a badfella!
#
#
#Why doesn't someone just step on
#this creep, and we can all go home?!
#
#
#- Order in this court!
#- You're all thinking it!
#
#
#Order! Order, I say!
#
#
#- Say it!
#- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
#
#
#I think it was awfully nice
#of that bear to pitch in like that.
#
#
#I think the jury's on our side.
#
#
#Are we doing everything right, legally?
#
#
#I'm a florist.
#
#
#Right. Well, here's to a great team.
#
#
#To a great team!
#
#
#Well, hello.
#
#
#- Ken!
#- Hello.
#
#
#I didn't think you were coming.
#
#
#No, I was just late.
#I tried to call, but... the battery.
#
#
#I didn't want all this to go to waste,
#so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
#
#
#Oh, that was lucky.
#
#
#There's a little left.
#I could heat it up.
#
#
#Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
#
#
#So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
#
#
#I'm not much for the game myself.
#The ball's a little grabby.
#
#
#That's where I usually sit.
#Right... there.
#
#
#Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,
#
#
#and he agreed with me that eating with
#chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
#
#
#You think I don't see what you're doing?
#
#
#I know how hard it is to find
#the rightjob. We have that in common.
#
#
#Do we?
#
#
#Bees have 100 percent employment,
#but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
#
#
#That's just what
#I was thinking about doing.
#
#
#Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
#for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
#
#
#I'm going to drain the old stinger.
#
#
#Yeah, you do that.
#
#
#Look at that.
#
#
#You know, I've just about had it
#
#
#with your little mind games.
#
#
#- What's that?
#- Italian Vogue.
#
#
#Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
#
#
#A lot of ads.
#
#
#Remember what Van said, why is
#your life more valuable than mine?
#
#
#Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
#
#
#I think something stinks in here!
#
#
#I love the smell of flowers.
#
#
#How do you like the smell of flames?!
#
#
#Not as much.
#
#
#Water bug! Not taking sides!
#
#
#Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
#This is pathetic!
#
#
#I've got issues!
#
#
#Well, well, well, a royal flush!
#
#
#- You're bluffing.
#- Am I?
#
#
#Surf's up, dude!
#
#
#Poo water!
#
#
#That bowl is gnarly.
#
#
#Except for those dirty yellow rings!
#
#
#Kenneth! What are you doing?!
#
#
#You know, I don't even like honey!
#I don't eat it!
#
#
#We need to talk!
#
#
#He's just a little bee!
#
#
#And he happens to be
#the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
#
#
#Long time? What are you talking about?!
#Are there other bugs in your life?
#
#
#No, but there are other things bugging
#me in life. And you're one of them!
#
#
#Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
#
#
#My nerves are fried from riding
#on this emotional roller coaster!
#
#
#Goodbye, Ken.
#
#
#And for your information,
#
#
#I prefer sugar-free, artificial
#sweeteners made by man!
#
#
#I'm sorry about all that.
#
#
#I know it's got
#an aftertaste! I like it!
#
#
#I always felt there was some kind
#of barrier between Ken and me.
#
#
#I couldn't overcome it.
#Oh, well.
#
#
#Are you OK for the trial?
#
#
#I believe Mr. Montgomery
#is about out of ideas.
#
#
#We would like to call
#Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
#
#
#Good idea! You can really see why he's
#considered one of the best lawyers...
#
#
#Yeah.
#
#
#Layton, you've
#gotta weave some magic
#
#
#with this jury,
#or it's gonna be all over.
#
#
#Don't worry. The only thing I have
#to do to turn this jury around
#
#
#is to remind them
#of what they don't like about bees.
#
#
#- You got the tweezers?
#- Are you allergic?
#
#
#Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
#
#
#Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
#what I think we'd all like to know.
#
#
#What exactly is your relationship
#
#
#to that woman?
#
#
#We're friends.
#
#
#- Good friends?
#- Yes.
#
#
#How good? Do you live together?
#
#
#Wait a minute...
#
#
#Are you her little...
#
#
#...bedbug?
#
#
#I've seen a bee documentary or two.
#From what I understand,
#
#
#doesn't your queen give birth
#to all the bee children?
#
#
#- Yeah, but...
#- So those aren't your real parents!
#
#
#- Oh, Barry...
#- Yes, they are!
#
#
#Hold me back!
#
#
#You're an illegitimate bee,
#aren't you, Benson?
#
#
#He's denouncing bees!
#
#
#Don't y'all date your cousins?
#
#
#- Objection!
#- I'm going to pincushion this guy!
#
#
#Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
#
#
#Oh, I'm hit!!
#
#
#Oh, lordy, I am hit!
#
#
#Order! Order!
#
#
#The venom! The venom
#is coursing through my veins!
#
#
#I have been felled
#by a winged beast of destruction!
#
#
#You see? You can't treat them
#like equals! They're striped savages!
#
#
#Stinging's the only thing
#they know! It's their way!
#
#
#- Adam, stay with me.
#- I can't feel my legs.
#
#
#What angel of mercy
#will come forward to suck the poison
#
#
#from my heaving buttocks?
#
#
#I will have order in this court. Order!
#
#
#Order, please!
#
#
#The case of the honeybees
#versus the human race
#
#
#took a pointed turn against the bees
#
#
#yesterday when one of their legal
#team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
#
#
#- Hey, buddy.
#- Hey.
#
#
#- Is there much pain?
#- Yeah.
#
#
#I...
#
#
#I blew the whole case, didn't I?
#
#
#It doesn't matter. What matters is
#you're alive. You could have died.
#
#
#I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
#
#
#They got it from the cafeteria
#downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
#
#
#Look, there's
#a little celery still on it.
#
#
#What was it like to sting someone?
#
#
#I can't explain it. It was all...
#
#
#All adrenaline and then...
#and then ecstasy!
#
#
#All right.
#
#
#You think it was all a trap?
#
#
#Of course. I'm sorry.
#I flew us right into this.
#
#
#What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
#just a couple of bugs in this world.
#
#
#What will the humans do to us
#if they win?
#
#
#I don't know.
#
#
#I hear they put the roaches in motels.
#That doesn't sound so bad.
#
#
#Adam, they check in,
#but they don't check out!
#
#
#Oh, my.
#
#
#Oould you get a nurse
#to close that window?
#
#
#- Why?
#- The smoke.
#
#
#Bees don't smoke.
#
#
#Right. Bees don't smoke.
#
#
#Bees don't smoke!
#But some bees are smoking.
#
#
#That's it! That's our case!
#
#
#It is? It's not over?
#
#
#Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
#
#
#Get back to the court and stall.
#Stall any way you can.
#
#
#And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
#
#
#Mr. Flayman.
#
#
#Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
#
#
#Where is the rest of your team?
#
#
#Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
#
#
#Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
#
#
#and as a result,
#we don't make very good time.
#
#
#I actually heard a funny story about...
#
#
#Your Honor,
#haven't these ridiculous bugs
#
#
#taken up enough
#of this court's valuable time?
#
#
#How much longer will we allow
#these absurd shenanigans to go on?
#
#
#They have presented no compelling
#evidence to support their charges
#
#
#against my clients,
#who run legitimate businesses.
#
#
#I move for a complete dismissal
#of this entire case!
#
#
#Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
#
#
#to have to consider
#Mr. Montgomery's motion.
#
#
#But you can't! We have a terrific case.
#
#
#Where is your proof?
#Where is the evidence?
#
#
#Show me the smoking gun!
#
#
#Hold it, Your Honor!
#You want a smoking gun?
#
#
#Here is your smoking gun.
#
#
#What is that?
#
#
#It's a bee smoker!
#
#
#What, this?
#This harmless little contraption?
#
#
#This couldn't hurt a fly,
#let alone a bee.
#
#
#Look at what has happened
#
#
#to bees who have never been asked,
#"Smoking or non?"
#
#
#Is this what nature intended for us?
#
#
#To be forcibly addicted
#to smoke machines
#
#
#and man-made wooden slat work camps?
#
#
#Living out our lives as honey slaves
#to the white man?
#
#
#- What are we gonna do?
#- He's playing the species card.
#
#
#Ladies and gentlemen, please,
#free these bees!
#
#
#Free the bees! Free the bees!
#
#
#Free the bees!
#
#
#Free the bees! Free the bees!
#
#
#The court finds in favor of the bees!
#
#
#Vanessa, we won!
#
#
#I knew you could do it! High-five!
#
#
#Sorry.
#
#
#I'm OK! You know what this means?
#
#
#All the honey
#will finally belong to the bees.
#
#
#Now we won't have
#to work so hard all the time.
#
#
#This is an unholy perversion
#of the balance of nature, Benson.
#
#
#You'll regret this.
#
#
#Barry, how much honey is out there?
#
#
#All right. One at a time.
#
#
#Barry, who are you wearing?
#
#
#My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
#and I have no pants.
#
#
#- What if Montgomery's right?
#- What do you mean?
#
#
#We've been living the bee way
#a long time, 27 million years.
#
#
#Oongratulations on your victory.
#What will you demand as a settlement?
#
#
#First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
#of all bee work camps.
#
#
#Then we want back the honey
#that was ours to begin with,
#
#
#every last drop.
#
#
#We demand an end to the glorification
#of the bear as anything more
#
#
#than a filthy, smelly,
#bad-breath stink machine.
#
#
#We're all aware
#of what they do in the woods.
#
#
#Wait for my signal.
#
#
#Take him out.
#
#
#He'll have nauseous
#for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
#
#
#And we will no longer tolerate
#bee-negative nicknames...
#
#
#But it's just a prance-about stage name!
#
#
#...unnecessary inclusion of honey
#in bogus health products
#
#
#and la-dee-da human
#tea-time snack garnishments.
#
#
#Oan't breathe.
#
#
#Bring it in, boys!
#
#
#Hold it right there! Good.
#
#
#Tap it.
#
#
#Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
#and there's gallons more coming!
#
#
#- I think we need to shut down!
#- Shut down? We've never shut down.
#
#
#Shut down honey production!
#
#
#Stop making honey!
#
#
#Turn your key, sir!
#
#
#What do we do now?
#
#
#Oannonball!
#
#
#We're shutting honey production!
#
#
#Mission abort.
#
#
#Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
#Returning to base.
#
#
#Adam, you wouldn't believe
#how much honey was out there.
#
#
#Oh, yeah?
#
#
#What's going on? Where is everybody?
#
#
#- Are they out celebrating?
#- They're home.
#
#
#They don't know what to do.
#Laying out, sleeping in.
#
#
#I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
#to San Antonio with a cricket.
#
#
#At least we got our honey back.
#
#
#Sometimes I think, so what if humans
#liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
#
#
#It's the greatest thing in the world!
#I was excited to be part of making it.
#
#
#This was my new desk. This was my
#new job. I wanted to do it really well.
#
#
#And now...
#
#
#Now I can't.
#
#
#I don't understand
#why they're not happy.
#
#
#I thought their lives would be better!
#
#
#They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
#Honey really changes people.
#
#
#You don't have any idea
#what's going on, do you?
#
#
#- What did you want to show me?
#- This.
#
#
#What happened here?
#
#
#That is not the half of it.
#
#
#Oh, no. Oh, my.
#
#
#They're all wilting.
#
#
#Doesn't look very good, does it?
#
#
#No.
#
#
#And whose fault do you think that is?
#
#
#You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
#
#
#Bees?
#
#
#Specifically, me.
#
#
#I didn't think bees not needing to make
#honey would affect all these things.
#
#
#It's notjust flowers.
#Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
#
#
#That's our whole SAT test right there.
#
#
#Take away produce, that affects
#the entire animal kingdom.
#
#
#And then, of course...
#
#
#The human species?
#
#
#So if there's no more pollination,
#
#
#it could all just go south here,
#couldn't it?
#
#
#I know this is also partly my fault.
#
#
#How about a suicide pact?
#
#
#How do we do it?
#
#
#- I'll sting you, you step on me.
#- Thatjust kills you twice.
#
#
#Right, right.
#
#
#Listen, Barry...
#sorry, but I gotta get going.
#
#
#I had to open my mouth and talk.
#
#
#Vanessa?
#
#
#Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
#Where are you going?
#
#
#To the final Tournament of Roses parade
#in Pasadena.
#
#
#They've moved it to this weekend
#because all the flowers are dying.
#
#
#It's the last chance
#I'll ever have to see it.
#
#
#Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
#I never meant it to turn out like this.
#
#
#I know. Me neither.
#
#
#Tournament of Roses.
#Roses can't do sports.
#
#
#Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
#
#
#Roses!
#
#
#Vanessa!
#
#
#Roses?!
#
#
#Barry?
#
#
#- Roses are flowers!
#- Yes, they are.
#
#
#Flowers, bees, pollen!
#
#
#I know.
#That's why this is the last parade.
#
#
#Maybe not.
#Oould you ask him to slow down?
#
#
#Oould you slow down?
#
#
#Barry!
#
#
#OK, I made a huge mistake.
#This is a total disaster, all my fault.
#
#
#Yes, it kind of is.
#
#
#I've ruined the planet.
#I wanted to help you
#
#
#with the flower shop.
#I've made it worse.
#
#
#Actually, it's completely closed down.
#
#
#I thought maybe you were remodeling.
#
#
#But I have another idea, and it's
#greater than my previous ideas combined.
#
#
#I don't want to hear it!
#
#
#All right, they have the roses,
#the roses have the pollen.
#
#
#I know every bee, plant
#and flower bud in this park.
#
#
#All we gotta do is get what they've got
#back here with what we've got.
#
#
#- Bees.
#- Park.
#
#
#- Pollen!
#- Flowers.
#
#
#- Repollination!
#- Across the nation!
#
#
#Tournament of Roses,
#Pasadena, Oalifornia.
#
#
#They've got nothing
#but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
#
#
#Security will be tight.
#
#
#I have an idea.
#
#
#Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
#
#
#Official floral business. It's real.
#
#
#Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
#
#
#Thank you. It was a gift.
#
#
#Once inside,
#we just pick the right float.
#
#
#How about The Princess and the Pea?
#
#
#I could be the princess,
#and you could be the pea!
#
#
#Yes, I got it.
#
#
#- Where should I sit?
#- What are you?
#
#
#- I believe I'm the pea.
#- The pea?
#
#
#It goes under the mattresses.
#
#
#- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
#- I'm getting the marshal.
#
#
#You do that!
#This whole parade is a fiasco!
#
#
#Let's see what this baby'll do.
#
#
#Hey, what are you doing?!
#
#
#Then all we do
#is blend in with traffic...
#
#
#...without arousing suspicion.
#
#
#Once at the airport,
#there's no stopping us.
#
#
#Stop! Security.
#
#
#- You and your insect pack your float?
#- Yes.
#
#
#Has it been
#in your possession the entire time?
#
#
#Would you remove your shoes?
#
#
#- Remove your stinger.
#- It's part of me.
#
#
#I know. Just having some fun.
#Enjoy your flight.
#
#
#Then if we're lucky, we'll have
#just enough pollen to do the job.
#
#
#Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
#have just enough pollen to do the job!
#
#
#I think this is gonna work.
#
#
#It's got to work.
#
#
#Attention, passengers,
#this is Oaptain Scott.
#
#
#We have a bit of bad weather
#in New York.
#
#
#It looks like we'll experience
#a couple hours delay.
#
#
#Barry, these are cut flowers
#with no water. They'll never make it.
#
#
#I gotta get up there
#and talk to them.
#
#
#Be careful.
#
#
#Oan I get help
#with the Sky Mall magazine?
#
#
#I'd like to order the talking
#inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
#
#
#Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.
#
#
#- What'd you say, Hal?
#- Nothing.
#
#
#Bee!
#
#
#Don't freak out! My entire species...
#
#
#What are you doing?
#
#
#- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
#- Who's an attorney?
#
#
#Don't move.
#
#
#Oh, Barry.
#
#
#Good afternoon, passengers.
#This is your captain.
#
#
#Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
#please report to the cockpit?
#
#
#And please hurry!
#
#
#What happened here?
#
#
#There was a DustBuster,
#a toupee, a life raft exploded.
#
#
#One's bald, one's in a boat,
#they're both unconscious!
#
#
#- Is that another bee joke?
#- No!
#
#
#No one's flying the plane!
#
#
#This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
#What's your status?
#
#
#This is Vanessa Bloome.
#I'm a florist from New York.
#
#
#Where's the pilot?
#
#
#He's unconscious,
#and so is the copilot.
#
#
#Not good. Does anyone onboard
#have flight experience?
#
#
#As a matter of fact, there is.
#
#
#- Who's that?
#- Barry Benson.
#
#
#From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
#
#
#Vanessa, this is nothing more
#than a big metal bee.
#
#
#It's got giant wings, huge engines.
#
#
#I can't fly a plane.
#
#
#- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
#- Yes.
#
#
#How hard could it be?
#
#
#Wait, Barry!
#We're headed into some lightning.
#
#
#This is Bob Bumble. We have some
#late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
#
#
#where a suspenseful scene
#is developing.
#
#
#Barry Benson,
#fresh from his legal victory...
#
#
#That's Barry!
#
#
#...is attempting to land a plane,
#loaded with people, flowers
#
#
#and an incapacitated flight crew.
#
#
#Flowers?!
#
#
#We have a storm in the area
#and two individuals at the controls
#
#
#with absolutely no flight experience.
#
#
#Just a minute.
#There's a bee on that plane.
#
#
#I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
#and his no-account compadres.
#
#
#They've done enough damage.
#
#
#But isn't he your only hope?
#
#
#Technically, a bee
#shouldn't be able to fly at all.
#
#
#Their wings are too small...
#
#
#Haven't we heard this a million times?
#
#
#"The surface area of the wings
#and body mass make no sense."
#
#
#- Get this on the air!
#- Got it.
#
#
#- Stand by.
#- We're going live.
#
#
#The way we work may be a mystery to you.
#
#
#Making honey takes a lot of bees
#doing a lot of small jobs.
#
#
#But let me tell you about a small job.
#
#
#If you do it well,
#it makes a big difference.
#
#
#More than we realized.
#To us, to everyone.
#
#
#That's why I want to get bees
#back to working together.
#
#
#That's the bee way!
#We're not made of Jell-O.
#
#
#We get behind a fellow.
#
#
#- Black and yellow!
#- Hello!
#
#
#Left, right, down, hover.
#
#
#- Hover?
#- Forget hover.
#
#
#This isn't so hard.
#Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
#
#
#Barry, what happened?!
#
#
#Wait, I think we were
#on autopilot the whole time.
#
#
#- That may have been helping me.
#- And now we're not!
#
#
#So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
#
#
#All of you, let's get
#behind this fellow! Move it out!
#
#
#Move out!
#
#
#Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
#you copy me with the wings of the plane!
#
#
#Don't have to yell.
#
#
#I'm not yelling!
#We're in a lot of trouble.
#
#
#It's very hard to concentrate
#with that panicky tone in your voice!
#
#
#It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
#
#
#I can't do this!
#
#
#Vanessa, pull yourself together.
#You have to snap out of it!
#
#
#You snap out of it.
#
#
#You snap out of it.
#
#
#- You snap out of it!
#- You snap out of it!
#
#
#- You snap out of it!
#- You snap out of it!
#
#
#- You snap out of it!
#- You snap out of it!
#
#
#- Hold it!
#- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.
#
#
#How is the plane flying?
#
#
#I don't know.
#
#
#Hello?
#
#
#Benson, got any flowers
#for a happy occasion in there?
#
#
#The Pollen Jocks!
#
#
#They do get behind a fellow.
#
#
#- Black and yellow.
#- Hello.
#
#
#All right, let's drop this tin can
#on the blacktop.
#
#
#Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?
#
#
#No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
#
#
#Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.
#
#
#- Thinking bee.
#- Thinking bee.
#
#
#Thinking bee!
#Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
#
#
#Wait a minute.
#I think I'm feeling something.
#
#
#- What?
#- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
#
#
#Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
#
#
#Bring the nose down.
#
#
#Thinking bee!
#Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
#
#
#- What in the world is on the tarmac?
#- Get some lights on that!
#
#
#Thinking bee!
#Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
#
#
#- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
#- OK.
#
#
#Out the engines. We're going in
#on bee power. Ready, boys?
#
#
#Affirmative!
#
#
#Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
#
#
#Land on that flower!
#
#
#Ready? Full reverse!
#
#
#Spin it around!
#
#
#- Not that flower! The other one!
#- Which one?
#
#
#- That flower.
#- I'm aiming at the flower!
#
#
#That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
#I mean the giant pulsating flower
#
#
#made of millions of bees!
#
#
#Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
#
#
#Rotate around it.
#
#
#- This is insane, Barry!
#- This's the only way I know how to fly.
#
#
#Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
#flying in an insect-like pattern?
#
#
#Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
#Smell it. Full reverse!
#
#
#Just drop it. Be a part of it.
#
#
#Aim for the center!
#
#
#Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
#
#
#Oome on, already.
#
#
#Barry, we did it!
#You taught me how to fly!
#
#
#- Yes. No high-five!
#- Right.
#
#
#Barry, it worked!
#Did you see the giant flower?
#
#
#What giant flower? Where? Of course
#I saw the flower! That was genius!
#
#
#- Thank you.
#- But we're not done yet.
#
#
#Listen, everyone!
#
#
#This runway is covered
#with the last pollen
#
#
#from the last flowers
#available anywhere on Earth.
#
#
#That means this is our last chance.
#
#
#We're the only ones who make honey,
#pollinate flowers and dress like this.
#
#
#If we're gonna survive as a species,
#this is our moment! What do you say?
#
#
#Are we going to be bees, orjust
#Museum of Natural History keychains?
#
#
#We're bees!
#
#
#Keychain!
#
#
#Then follow me! Except Keychain.
#
#
#Hold on, Barry. Here.
#
#
#You've earned this.
#
#
#Yeah!
#
#
#I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
#fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
#
#
#Oh, yeah.
#
#
#That's our Barry.
#
#
#Mom! The bees are back!
#
#
#If anybody needs
#to make a call, now's the time.
#
#
#I got a feeling we'll be
#working late tonight!
#
#
#Here's your change. Have a great
#afternoon! Oan I help who's next?
#
#
#Would you like some honey with that?
#It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
#
#
#Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
#And I don't see a nickel!
#
#
#Sometimes I just feel
#like a piece of meat!
#
#
#I had no idea.
#
#
#Barry, I'm sorry.
#Have you got a moment?
#
#
#Would you excuse me?
#My mosquito associate will help you.
#
#
#Sorry I'm late.
#
#
#He's a lawyer too?
#
#
#I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
#All I needed was a briefcase.
#
#
#Have a great afternoon!
#
#
#Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
#and I can't get them anywhere.
#
#
#No problem, Vannie.
#Just leave it to me.
#
#
#You're a lifesaver, Barry.
#Oan I help who's next?
#
#
#All right, scramble, jocks!
#It's time to fly.
#
#
#Thank you, Barry!
#
#
#That bee is living my life!
#
#
#Let it go, Kenny.
#
#
#- When will this nightmare end?!
#- Let it all go.
#
#
#- Beautiful day to fly.
#- Sure is.
#
#
#Between you and me,
#I was dying to get out of that office.
#
#
#You have got
#to start thinking bee, my friend.
#
#
#- Thinking bee!
#- Me?
#
#
#Hold it. Let's just stop
#for a second. Hold it.
#
#
#I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
#Oan we stop here?
#
#
#I'm not making a major life decision
#during a production number!
#
#
#All right. Take ten, everybody.
#Wrap it up, guys.
#
#
#I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

#
#The Airbus A350 is a long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner developed and produced by Airbus. The first A350 design proposed by Airbus in 2004, in response to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, would have been a development of the Airbus A330 with composite wings and new engines. As market support was inadequate, in 2006, Airbus switched to a clean-sheet "XWB" (eXtra Wide Body) design, powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent XWB high bypass turbofan engines. The prototype first flew on 14 June 2013 from Toulouse, France. Type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was obtained in September 2014, followed by certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) two months later.
#
#The A350 is the first Airbus aircraft largely made of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymers. It has a new fuselage designed around a nine-abreast economy cross-section, up from the eight-abreast A330/A340. It has a common type rating with the A330. The airliner has two variants: the A350-900 typically carries 300 to 350 passengers over a 15,000-kilometre (8,100-nautical-mile; 9,300-statute-mile) range, and has a 283-tonne (617,300-pound) maximum takeoff weight (MTOW); the longer A350-1000 accommodates 350 to 410 passengers and has a maximum range of 16,100 km (8,700 nmi; 10,000 mi) and a 319 t (703,200 lb) MTOW.
#
#On 15 January 2015, the initial A350-900 entered service with Qatar Airways, followed by the A350-1000 on 24 February 2018 with the same launch customer. As of November 2023, Singapore Airlines is the largest operator with 63 A350-900 aircraft in its fleet. A350 orders stood at 1072 aircraft, of which 571 had been delivered and all were in service with 39 operators. The global A350 fleet had completed more than 1,175,000 flights on more than 1070 routes without accidents. It succeeds the A340 and competes against Boeing's large long-haul twinjets: the Boeing 777, and its successor, the 777X.
#Development
#Background and early designs
#
#Airbus initially rejected Boeing's claim that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner would be a serious threat to the Airbus A330, stating that the 787 was just a reaction to the A330 and that no response was needed. When airlines urged Airbus to provide a competitor, Airbus initially proposed the "A330-200Lite", a derivative of the A330 featuring improved aerodynamics and engines similar to those on the 787. The company planned to announce this version at the 2004 Farnborough Airshow, but did not proceed.[5]
#The initial A350 concept, based on the A330
#
#On 16 September 2004, Airbus president and chief executive officer Noël Forgeard confirmed the consideration of a new project during a private meeting with prospective customers. Forgeard did not give a project name, and did not state whether it would be an entirely new design or a modification of an existing product. Airline dissatisfaction with this proposal motivated Airbus to commit €4 billion to a new airliner design.[5]
#
#On 10 December 2004, Airbus' shareholders, EADS and BAE Systems, approved the "authorisation to offer" for the A350, expecting a 2010 service entry. Airbus then expected to win more than half of the 250-300 seat aircraft market, estimated at 3,100 aircraft overall over 20 years. Based on the A330, the 245-seat A350-800 was to fly over a 8,600 nmi (15,900 km; 9,900 mi) range and the 285-seat A350-900 over a 7,500 nmi (13,900 km; 8,600 mi) range. Fuel efficiency would improve by over 10% with a mostly carbon fibre reinforced polymer wing and initial General Electric GEnx-72A1 engines, before offering a choice of powerplant.[6] It had a common fuselage cross-section with the A330 and also a new horizontal stabiliser.[5]
#
#On 13 June 2005 at the Paris Air Show, Middle Eastern carrier Qatar Airways announced that they had placed an order for 60 A350s. In September 2006 the airline signed a memorandum of understanding with General Electric (GE) to launch the GEnx-1A-72 engine for the new airliner model.[7][8][9] Emirates sought a more improved design and decided against ordering the initial version of the A350.[10][11]
#
#On 6 October 2005, the programme's industrial launch was announced with an estimated development cost of around €3.5 billion.[5] The A350 was initially planned to be a 250- to 300-seat twin-engine wide-body aircraft derived from the existing A330's design. Under this plan, the A350 would have modified wings and new engines while sharing the A330's fuselage cross-section. For this design, the fuselage was to consist primarily of aluminium-lithium rather than the carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) fuselage on the Boeing 787. The A350 would see entry in two versions: the A350-800 with a 8,800 nmi (16,300 km; 10,100 mi) range with a typical passenger capacity of 253 in a three-class configuration, and the A350-900 with 7,500 nmi (13,900 km; 8,600 mi) range and a 300-seat 3-class configuration. The A350 was designed to be a direct competitor to the Boeing 787-9 and 777-200ER.[5]
#
#The original A350 design was publicly criticised by two of Airbus's largest customers, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). On 28 March 2006, ILFC President Steven F. Udvar-Házy urged Airbus to pursue a clean-sheet design or risk losing market share to Boeing and branded Airbus's strategy as "a Band-aid reaction to the 787", a sentiment echoed by GECAS president Henry Hubschman.[12][13] In April 2006, while reviewing bids for the Boeing 787 and A350, the CEO of Singapore Airlines (SIA) Chew Choon Seng, commented that "having gone through the trouble of designing a new wing, tail," and "cockpit," Airbus "should have gone the whole hog and designed a new fuselage."[14]
#
#Airbus responded that they were considering A350 improvements to satisfy customer demands. Airbus's then-CEO Gustav Humbert stated, "Our strategy isn't driven by the needs of the next one or two campaigns, but rather by a long-term view of the market and our ability to deliver on our promises."[15][16] As major airlines such as Qantas and Singapore Airlines selected the 787 over the A350, Humbert tasked an engineering team to produce new alternative designs.[17][18] One such proposal, known internally as "1d", formed the basis of the A350 redesign.[18]
#Redesign and launch
#A model of the new design at ILA Berlin Air Show 2008
#
#On 14 July 2006, during the Farnborough International Airshow, the redesigned aircraft was designated "A350 XWB" (Xtra-Wide-Body).[19] Within four days, Singapore Airlines agreed to order 20 A350 XWBs with options for another 20 A350 XWBs.[20]
#
#The proposed A350 was a new design, including a wider fuselage cross-section, allowing seating arrangements ranging from an eight-abreast low-density premium economy layout to a ten-abreast high-density seating configuration for a maximum seating capacity of 440–475 depending on variant.[21][22] The A330 and previous iterations of the A350 would only be able to accommodate a maximum of eight seats per row. The 787 is typically configured for nine seats per row.[23] The 777 accommodates nine or ten seats per row, with more than half of recent 777s being configured in a ten-abreast layout that will come standard on the 777X.[24] The A350 cabin is 12.7 cm (5.0 in) wider at the eye level of a seated passenger than the 787's cabin,[25] and 28 cm (11 in) narrower than the Boeing 777's cabin (see the Wide-body aircraft comparison of cabin widths and seating). All A350 passenger models have a range of at least 8,000 nmi (14,816 km; 9,206 mi). The redesigned composite fuselage allows for higher cabin pressure and humidity, and lower maintenance costs.
#
#On 1 December 2006, the Airbus board of directors approved the industrial launch of the A350-800, -900, and -1000 variants.[26] The delayed launch decision was a result of delays to the Airbus A380[27] and discussions on how to fund development. EADS CEO Thomas Enders stated that the A350 programme was not a certainty, citing EADS/Airbus's stretched resources.[28] However, it was decided programme costs are to be borne mainly from cash-flow. First delivery for the A350-900 was scheduled for mid-2013, with the -800 and -1000 following on 12 and 24 months later, respectively.[26] New technical details of the A350 XWB were revealed at a press conference in December 2006. Chief operating officer, John Leahy indicated existing A350 contracts were being re-negotiated due to price increases compared to the original A350s contracted. On 4 January 2007, Pegasus Aviation Finance Company placed the first firm order for the A350 XWB with an order for two aircraft.[29]
#
#The design change imposed a two-year delay into the original timetable and increased development costs from US$5.3 billion (€5.5 billion) to approximately US$10 billion (€9.7 billion).[30] Reuters estimated the A350's total development cost at US$15 billion (€12 billion or £10 billion).[31][32] The original mid-2013 delivery date of the A350 was changed, as a longer than anticipated development forced Airbus to delay the final assembly and first flight of the aircraft to the third quarter of 2012 and second quarter of 2013 respectively. As a result, the flight test schedule was compressed from the original 15 months to 12 months. A350 programme chief Didier Evrard stressed that delays only affected the A350-900 while the -800 and -1000 schedules remained unchanged.[33] Airbus' 2019 earnings report indicated the A350 programme had broken even that year.[34][better source needed]
#Design phase
#A plan of the A350 XWB's new nose and general arrangement inside the forward fuselage
#
#Airbus suggested Boeing's use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs,[35] Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 the adoption of composite fuselage frames for the aircraft structure.[36][37] The composite frames would feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage, for dissipating lightning strikes.[38] Airbus used a full mock up fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was all done on computers.[39]
#
#In 2006, Airbus confirmed development of a full bleed air system on the A350, as opposed to the 787's bleedless configuration.[40][41][42] Rolls-Royce agreed with Airbus to supply a new variant of the Trent turbofan engine for the A350 XWB, named Trent XWB. In 2010, after low-speed wind tunnel tests, Airbus finalised the static thrust at sea level for all three proposed variants to the 74,000–94,000 lbf (330–420 kN) range.[43]
#
#GE stated it would not offer the GP7000 engine on the aircraft, and that previous contracts for the GEnx on the original A350 did not apply to the XWB.[44] Engine Alliance partner Pratt & Whitney seemed to be unaligned with GE on this, having publicly stated that it was looking at an advanced derivative of the GP7000.[45] In April 2007, former Airbus CEO Louis Gallois held direct talks with GE management over developing a GEnx variant for the A350 XWB.[46][47] In June 2007, John Leahy indicated that the A350 XWB would not feature the GEnx engine, saying that Airbus wanted GE to offer a more efficient version for the airliner.[48] Since then, the largest GE engines operators, which include Emirates, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and ILFC have selected the Trent XWB for their A350 orders. In May 2009, GE said that if it were to reach a deal with Airbus to offer the current 787-optimised GEnx for the A350, it would only power the -800 and -900 variants. GE believed it could offer a product that outperforms the Trent 1000 and Trent XWB, but was reluctant to support an aircraft competing directly with its GE90-115B-powered 777 variants.[49]
#
#In January 2008, French-based Thales Group won a US$2.9 billion (€2 billion) 20-year contract to supply avionics and navigation equipment for the A350 XWB, beating Honeywell and Rockwell Collins.[50] US-based Rockwell Collins and Moog Inc. were chosen to supply the horizontal stabiliser actuator and primary flight control actuation, respectively. The flight management system incorporated several new safety features.[51] Regarding cabin ergonomics and entertainment, in 2006 Airbus signed a firm contract with BMW for development of an interior concept for the original A350.[52] On 4 February 2010, Airbus signed a contract with Panasonic Avionics Corporation to deliver in-flight entertainment and communication (IFEC) systems for the Airbus A350 XWB.[53]
#Production
#A partially-complete A350-900 XWB (destined for Finnair) on the Toulouse assembly line, December 2014
#
#In 2008, Airbus planned to start cabin furnishing early in parallel with final assembly to cut production time in half.[54] The A350 XWB production programme sees extensive international collaboration and investments in new facilities: Airbus constructed 10 new factories in Western Europe and the US, with extensions carried out on three further sites.[55]
#
#Among the new buildings was a £570 million (US$760 million or €745 million) composite facility in Broughton, Wales, which would be responsible for the wings.[56] In June 2009, the National Assembly for Wales announced provision of a £28 million grant to provide a training centre, production jobs and money toward the new production centre.[57]
#
#Airbus manufactured the first structural component in December 2009.[58] Production of the first fuselage barrel began in late 2010 at its production plant in Illescas, Spain.[59] Construction of the first A350-900 centre wingbox was set to start in August 2010.[60] The new composite rudder plant in China opened in early 2011.[61] The forward fuselage of the first A350 was delivered to the final assembly plant in Toulouse on 29 December 2011.[62] Final assembly of the first A350 static test model was started on 5 April 2012.[63] Final assembly of the first prototype A350 was completed in December 2012.[64]
#
#In 2018, the unit cost of the A350-900 was US$317.4 million and the A350-1000 was US$366.5 million.[65] The production rate was expected to rise from three aircraft per month in early 2015 to five at the end of 2015, and would ramp to ten aircraft per month by 2018.[66] In 2015, 17 planes would be delivered and the initial dispatch reliability was 98%.[67] Airbus announced plans to increase its production rate from 10 monthly in 2018 to 13 monthly from 2019 and six A330 are produced monthly.[68] Around 90 deliveries were expected for 2018, with 15% or ≈14 units being A350-1000 variants.[69] That year, 93 aircraft were delivered, three more than expected.[70] In 2019, Airbus delivered 112 A350s (87 A350-900s and 25 A350-1000s) at a rate of 10 per month, and were going to keep the rate around nine to 10 per month, to reflect softer demand for widebodies, as the backlog reached 579 − or 5.2 years of production at a constant rate.[71] The coronavirus crisis caused the decrease of A350 production from 9.5 per month to six per month, since April 2020.[72] After the crisis a ramp-up is planned, aiming to reach a rate of 9 per month by the end of 2025.[73]
#Testing and certification
#A prototype Airbus A350-900 XWB (registered as F-WXWB) during its first flight
#
#The first Trent engine test was made on 14 June 2010.[74] The Trent XWB's flight test programme began use on the A380 development aircraft in early 2011, ahead of engine certification in late 2011. On 2 June 2013, the Trent XWB engines were powered up on the A350 for the first time. Airbus confirmed that the flight test programme would last 12 months and use five test aircraft.[75]
#
#The A350's maiden flight took place on 14 June 2013 from the Toulouse–Blagnac Airport.[1] Airbus's chief test pilot said, "it just seemed really happy in the air...all the things we were testing had no major issues at all."[76] It flew for four hours, reaching Mach 0.8 at 25,000 feet after retracting the landing gear and starting a 2,500 h flight test campaign.[77] Costs for developing the aircraft were estimated at €11 billion (US$15 billion or £9.5 billion) in June 2013.[78]
#
#A350 XWB msn. 2 underwent two-and-a-half weeks of climatic tests in the unique McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in May 2014, and was subjected to multiple climatic and humidity settings from a high of 45 °C (113 °F) to as low as −40 °C (−40 °F).[79]
#
#The A350 received type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on 30 September 2014.[80] On 15 October 2014, EASA approved the A350-900 for ETOPS 370, allowing it to fly more than six hours on one engine and making it the first airliner to be approved for "ETOPS Beyond 180 minutes" before entry into service.[81] Later that month Airbus received regulatory approval for a Common Type Rating for pilot training between the A350 XWB and A330.[82] On 12 November 2014, the A350 received certification from the FAA.[83] On 1 August 2017, the EASA issued an airworthiness directive mandating operators to power cycle (reset) early A350-900s before 149 hours of continuous power-on time, reissued in July 2019.[84]
#Entry into service
#Qatar Airways' first A350-900 XWB (registration: A7-ALA) after the first commercial flight to Frankfurt Airport
#
#In June 2011, the A350-900 was scheduled to enter service in the first half of 2014, with the -800 to enter service in mid-2016, and the -1000 in 2017.[85] In July 2012, Airbus delayed the -900's introduction by three months to the second half of 2014.[86] The delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways took place on 22 December 2014.[87] The first commercial flight was made on 15 January 2015 between Doha and Frankfurt.[2]
#
#The first A350-1000 was assembled in 2016 and had its first flight on 24 November 2016.[88] The aircraft was then delivered on 20 February 2018 to Qatar Airways, which had also been the launch operator of the -900.[89] and entered the commercial service with a flight from Doha to London on 24 February 2018.[90]
#Shorter A350-800
#
#The 60.45 m (198.3 ft)-long A350-800 was designed to seat 276 passengers in a typical three-class configuration with a range of 8,245 nmi (15,270 km; 9,488 mi) with an MTOW of 259 t (571,000 lb).[91]
#
#In January 2010, Airbus opted to develop the -800 as a shrink of the baseline -900 to simplify development and increase its payload by 3 t (6,600 lb) or its range by 250 nmi (460 km; 290 mi), but this led to a fuel burn penalty of "a couple of percent", according to John Leahy.[92] The previously planned optimisation to the structure and landing gear was not beneficial enough against better commonality and maximum takeoff weight increase by 11t from 248t.[93] The −800's fuselage is 10 frames shorter (six forward and four aft of wing) than the −900 aircraft.[94] It was designed to supplement the Airbus A330-200 long-range twin.[95] Airbus planned to decrease structural weight in the -800 as development continued, which should have been around airframe 20.[96]
#
#While its backlog reached 182 in mid-2008, it diminished since 2010 as customers switched to the larger -900.[97] After launching the Airbus A330neo at the 2014 Farnborough Airshow, Airbus dropped the A350-800, with its CEO Fabrice Brégier saying "I believe all of our customers will either convert to the A350-900 or the A330neo".[98] He later confirmed at a September 2014 press conference that development of the A350-800 had been "cancelled."[99] There were 16 orders left for the -800 since Yemenia switched to the -900 and Hawaiian Airlines moved to the A330neo in December 2014: eight for Aeroflot and eight for Asiana Airlines, both also having orders for the -900.[100] In January 2017, Aeroflot and Airbus announced the cancellation of its -800 order, leaving Asiana Airlines as the only customer for the variant.[101] After the negotiation between Airbus and Asiana Airlines,[102] Asiana converted orders of eight A350-800s and one A350-1000 to nine A350-900s.[103]
#Longer A350-1000
#
#In 2011, Airbus redesigned the A350-1000 with higher weights and a more powerful engine variant to provide more range for trans-Pacific operations. This boosted its appeal to Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines, who were committed to purchase 20 Boeing 777-9s, and to United Airlines, which was considering Boeing 777-300ERs to replace its 747-400s.[104] Emirates was disappointed with the changes and cancelled its order for 50 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s, instead of changing the whole order to the larger variant.[104]
#
#Assembly of the first fuselage major components started in September 2015.[105] In February 2016, final assembly started at the A350 Final Assembly Line in Toulouse. Three flight test aircraft were planned, with entry into service scheduled for mid-2017.[106] The first aircraft completed its body join on 15 April 2016.[107] Its maiden flight took place on 24 November 2016.[88]
#
#The A350-1000 flight test programme planned for 1,600 flight hours; 600 hours on the first aircraft, MSN59, for the flight envelope, systems and powerplant checks; 500 hours on MSN71 for cold and warm campaigns, landing gear checks and high-altitude tests; and 500 hours on MSN65 for route proving and ETOPS assessment, with an interior layout for cabin development and certification.[108] In cruise at Mach 0.854 (911.9 km/h; 492.4 kn) and 35,000 ft, its fuel flow at 259 t (571,000 lb) is 6.8 t (15,000 lb) per hour within a 5,400 nautical miles (10,000 km; 6,200 mi), 11 1/2 hours early long test flight.[109] Flight tests allowed raising the MTOW from 308 to 316 t (679,000 to 697,000 lb), the 8 t (18,000 lb) increase giving 450 nmi (830 km; 520 mi) more range.[110] Airbus then completed functional and reliability testing.[111]
#
#Type Certification was awarded by EASA on 21 November 2017,[112] along FAA certification. The first serial unit was on the final assembly line in early December.[113] After its maiden flight on 7 December 2017, delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways slipped to early 2018.[114] The delay was due to issues with the business class seat installation.[115] It was delivered on 20 February 2018[116] and entered commercial service on Qatar Airways' Doha to London Heathrow route on 24 February 2018.[117]
#Possible further stretch
#
#Airbus has explored the possibility of a further stretch offering 45 more seats.[118] A potential 4 m stretch would remain within the exit limit of four door pairs, and a modest MTOW increase from 308 t to 319 t would need only 3% more thrust, within the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 capabilities, and would allow a 7,600 nmi (14,100 km; 8,700 mi) range to compete with the 777-9's capabilities.[119] This variant was to be a replacement for the 747-400,[120] tentatively called the A350-8000,[121] -2000[122] or -1100.[118]
#
#At the June 2016 Airbus Innovation Days, chief commercial officer John Leahy was concerned about the size of a 400-seat market besides the Boeing 747-8 and the 777-9 and chief executive Fabrice Brégier feared such an aircraft could cannibalise demand for the -1000.[122] The potential 79 m-long (258 ft) aeroplane was competing against a hypothetical 777-10X for Singapore Airlines.[123] At the 2017 Paris Air Show, the concept was shelved for lacking market appeal and in January 2018 Brégier focused on enhancing the A350-900/1000 to capture potential before 2022/2023, when it will be possible to stretch the A350 with a new engine generation.[124]

#In October 2017, Airbus was testing extended sharklets, which could offer 100–140 nmi (185–259 km; 115–161 mi) extra range and reduce fuel burn by 1.4–1.6%.[125] The wing twist is being changed for the wider, optimised spanload pressure distribution, and will be used for the Singapore Airlines A350-900ULR in 2018 before spreading to other variants.[126] On 26 June 2018, Iberia was the first to receive the upgraded -900, with a 280 t (620,000 lb) MTOW version for an 8,200 nmi (15,200 km; 9,400 mi) range with 325 passengers in three classes.[127][128]
#
#By April 2019, Airbus was testing a hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) on the leading edge of an A350 prototype vertical stabilizer, with passive suction similar to the boundary layer control on the Boeing 787-9 tail, but unlike the natural laminar flow BLADE, within the same EU Clean Sky program.[129]
#
#On 30 September 2022, a 1.2 t (2,600 lb) weight reduction and a 3 t (6,600 lb) MTOW increase was announced, along with a wider interior cabin to offer 30 additional seats.[130] The interior changes include moving the cockpit wall forward, moving the aft pressure bulkhead one frame further aft and resculpting the sidewalls to allow ten-abreast 17-inch seats.[131]
#New Engine Option
#
#By November 2018, Airbus was hiring in Toulouse and Madrid to develop a re-engined A350neo. Although its launch is not guaranteed, it would be delivered in the mid-2020s, after the A321XLR and a stretched A320neo "plus", potentially competing with the Boeing New Midsize Airplane. Service entry would be determined by ultra-high bypass ratio engine developments pursued by Pratt & Whitney, testing its Geared Turbofan upgrade; Safran Aircraft Engines, ground testing a demonstrator from 2021; and Rolls-Royce, targeting a 2025 Ultrafan service entry. The production target is a monthly rate of 20 A350neos, up from 10.[132]
#
#In November 2019, General Electric was offering an advanced GEnx-1 variant with a bleed air system and improvements from the GE9X, developed for the delayed Boeing 777X, to power a proposed A350neo from the mid-2020s.[133]
#Design
#The A350 demonstrator painted like carbon fibre weaves
#
#Airbus expected 10% lower airframe maintenance compared with the original A350 design and 14% lower empty seat weight than the Boeing 777.[134] Design freeze for the A350-900 was achieved in December 2008.[135] The airframe is made out of 53% composites: CFRP for the empennage (vertical and horizontal tailplanes), the wing (centre and outer box; including covers, stringers, and spars), and fuselage (keel beam, rear fuselage, skin, and frame); 19% aluminium and aluminium–lithium alloy for ribs, floor beams, and gear bays; 14% titanium for landing gears, pylons, and attachments; 6% steel; and 8% miscellaneous.[136] The A350's competitor, the Boeing 787, is 50% composites, 20% aluminium, 15% titanium, 10% steel, and 5% other.[137]
#Fuselage
#Nine-abreast Economy Class cabin
#
#The A350 features a new composite fuselage with a constant width from door 1 to door 4, unlike previous Airbus aircraft, to provide maximum usable volume.[138] The double-lobe (ovoid) fuselage cross-section has a maximum outer diameter of 5.97 m (19.6 ft), compared to 5.64 m (18.5 ft) for the A330/A340.[139] The cabin's internal width is 5.61 m (18.4 ft) at armrest level compared to 5.49 m (18.0 ft) in the Boeing 787[140] and 5.87 m (19.3 ft) in the Boeing 777. It allows for an eight-abreast 2–4–2 arrangement in a premium economy layout,[b] with the seats being 49.5 cm (19.5 in) wide between 5 cm (2.0 in) wide arm rests. Airbus states that the seat will be 1.3 cm (0.5 in) wider than a 787 seat in the equivalent configuration.
#
#In the nine-abreast, 3–3–3 standard economy layout, the A350 seat will be 45 cm (18 in) wide, 1.27 cm (0.5 in) wider than a seat in the equivalent layout in the 787,[141] and 3.9 cm (1.5 in) wider than a seat in the equivalent A330 layout.[142] The current 777 and future derivatives have 1.27 cm (0.5 in) greater seat width than the A350 in a nine-abreast configuration.[143][144][145] The 10-abreast seating on the A350 is similar to a 9-abreast configuration on the A330, with a seat width of 41.65 cm (16.4 in).[21][146] Overall, the A350 gives passengers more headroom, larger overhead storage space, and wider panoramic windows than current Airbus models.
#
#The A350 nose section has a configuration derived from the A380 with a forward-mounted nosegear bay and a six-panel flightdeck windscreen.[147] This differs substantially from the four-window arrangement in the original design.[148] The new nose, made of aluminium,[149] improves aerodynamics and enables overhead crew rest areas to be installed further forward and eliminate any encroachment in the passenger cabin. The new windscreen has been revised to improve vision by reducing the width of the centre post. The upper shell radius of the nose section has been increased.[150]
#Wing
#The Airbus A350's blended winglets
#
#The A350 features new composite wings with a wingspan that is common to the proposed variants.[151] Its 64.75 m (212.4 ft) wingspan stays within the same ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code E 65m limit as the A330/A340[152] and the Boeing 777.[153] The A350's wing has a 31.9° sweep angle for a Mach 0.85 cruise speed and has a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.89.[154]
#
#The -900 wing covers a 442 m2 (4,760 sq ft) area.[155] This is between the 436.8 m2 (4,702 sq ft) wing of the current Boeing 777-200LR/300ER and the 466.8 m2 (5,025 sq ft) wing of the in-development Boeing 777X.[156] However, Boeing and Airbus do not use the same measurement.[157] The A350-1000 wing is 22.3 m2 (240 sq ft) larger through a 30 cm (12 in) extension to the inboard sections of the fixed trailing edge.[158]
#
#A new trailing-edge high-lift device has been adopted with an advanced dropped-hinge flap similar to that of the A380, which permits the gap between the trailing edge and the flap to be closed with the spoiler.[159] It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect together and differential flaps setting for lateral load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect differentially.[160]
#
#The manufacturer has extensively used computational fluid dynamics and also carried out more than 4,000 hours of low- and high-speed windtunnel testing to refine the aerodynamic design.[161] The final configuration of wing and winglet was achieved for the "Maturity Gate 5" on 17 December 2008.[162] The wingtip device curves upwards over the final 4.4 m (14 ft).[138] The wings are produced in the new £400 million (US$641M), 46,000 m2 (500,000 sq ft) North Factory at Airbus Broughton, employing 650 workers, in a specialist facility constructed with £29M of support from the Welsh Government.[163]
#Undercarriage
#
#Airbus adopted a new philosophy for the attachment of the A350's main undercarriage as part of the switch to a composite wing structure. Each main undercarriage leg is attached to the rear wing spar forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double side-stay configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10.[164]
#
#Airbus devised a three-pronged main undercarriage design philosophy encompassing both four- and six-wheel bogies to stay within pavement loading limits. The A350-900 has four-wheel bogies in a 4.1 m (13 ft) long bay. The higher weight variant, the A350-1000 uses a six-wheel bogie, with a 4.7 m (15 ft) undercarriage bay.[165] French-based Messier-Dowty provides the main undercarriage for the -900 variant, with titanium forgings from Kobelco,[166][167] and UTC Aerospace Systems supplies the -1000 variant. The nose gear is supplied by Liebherr Aerospace.[168]
#
#    The A350-900 has a four-wheel main gear for a 283 t (624,000 lb) MTOW.
#    The A350-900 has a four-wheel main gear for a 283 t (624,000 lb) MTOW.
#    The A350-1000 has a six-wheel main landing gear to support a 322 t (710,000 lb) MTOW.
#    The A350-1000 has a six-wheel main landing gear to support a 322 t (710,000 lb) MTOW.
#
#Systems
#
#Honeywell supplies its 1,700 horsepower (1,300 kW) HGT1700 auxiliary power unit with 10% greater power density than the TPE331 from which it is developed, and the air management system: the bleed air, environmental control, cabin pressure control and supplemental cooling systems.[169] Airbus says that the new design provides a better cabin atmosphere with 20% humidity, a typical cabin altitude at or below 6,000 ft (1,800 m) and an airflow management system that adapts cabin airflow to passenger load with draught-free air circulation.[170]
#
#The ram air turbine, capable of generating 100 kilovolt-ampere, is supplied by Hamilton Sundstrand and located in the lower surface of the fuselage.[171] In light of the 787 Dreamliner battery problems, in February 2013 Airbus decided to revert from lithium-ion to the proven nickel-cadmium technology although the flight test programme will continue with the lithium-ion battery systems.[172] In late 2015, A350 XWB msn. 24 was delivered with 80 kg (176 lb) lighter Saft Li-ion batteries and in June 2017, fifty A350s were flying with them and benefiting from a two-year maintenance schedule instead of NiCd's 4–6 months.[173]
#
#Parker Hannifin supplies the complete fuel package: inerting system, fuel measurement and management systems, mechanical equipment and fuel pumps. The fuel tank inerting system features air-separation modules to generate nitrogen-enriched air to reduce the flammability of fuel vapour in the tanks. Parker also provides hydraulic power generation and distribution system: reservoirs, manifolds, accumulators, thermal control, isolation, software and new engine- and electric motor-driven pump designs. Parker estimates the contracts will generate more than US$2 billion in revenues over the life of the programme.[174]
#Cockpit and avionics
#The cockpit of the Airbus A350
#
#The revised design of the A350 XWB's glass cockpit dropped the A380-sized display and adopted 38 cm (15 in) liquid-crystal display screens. The new six-screen configuration includes two central displays mounted one above the other (the lower one above the thrust levers) and a single (for each pilot) primary flight/navigation display, with an adjacent on-board information system screen.[175] Airbus says the cockpit design allows for future advances in navigation technology to be placed on the displays plus gives flexibility and capacity to upload new software and to combine data from multiple sources and sensors for flight management and aircraft systems control.[176] An optional head-up display is also present in the cockpit.
#
#Avionics are a further development of the integrated modular avionics (IMA) concept found on the A380. The A350's IMA will manage up to 40 functions (versus 23 functions for the A380) such as undercarriage, fuel, pneumatics, cabin environmental systems, and fire detection.[148][176] Airbus stated that the benefits includes reduced maintenance and lower weight because as the IMA replaces multiple processors and LRUs with around 50% fewer standard computer modules known as line-replaceable modules. The IMA runs on a 100 Mbit/s network based on the AFDX standard, as employed in the A380, in place of the architecture used on the A330/A340.
#Propulsion
#The 84,000–97,000 lbf (370–430 kN) Rolls-Royce Trent XWB powers exclusively the A350.
#
#In 2005, GE was the launch engine of the original A350, aiming for 2010 deliveries, while Rolls-Royce offered its Trent 1700. For the updated A350 XWB, GE offered a 87,000 lbf (390 kN) GEnx-3A87 for the A350-800/900, but not a higher thrust version needed for the A350-1000, which competes with the longer range 777 powered exclusively with the GE90-115B. In December 2006, Rolls-Royce was selected for the A350 XWB launch engine.[133]
#
#The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB features a 300 cm (118 in) diameter fan and the design is based on the advanced developments of the Airbus A380 Trent 900 and the Boeing 787 Trent 1000. It has four thrust levels to power the A350 variants: 75,000 lbf (330 kN) and 79,000 lbf (350 kN) for the regional variants of the A350-900 while the baseline A350-900 has the standard 84,000 lbf (370 kN) and 97,000 lbf (430 kN) for the A350-1000.[177] The higher-thrust version will have some modifications to the fan module—it will be the same diameter but will run slightly faster and have a new fan blade design—and run at increased temperatures allowed by new materials technologies from Rolls-Royce's research.[178]
#
#The Trent XWB may also benefit from the next-generation reduced acoustic mode scattering engine duct system (RAMSES), an acoustic quieting engine nacelle intake, and a carry-on design of the Airbus's "zero splice" intake liner developed for the A380.[179] A "hot and high" rating option for Middle Eastern customers Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad Airways keep its thrust available at higher temperatures and altitudes.
#
#Airbus aimed to certify the A350 with 350-minute ETOPS capability on entry into service.[180] That could reach 420 min later,[181] although Airbus achieved a 370–minute ETOPS rating on 15 October 2014 which covers 99.7% of the Earth's surface.[182] Engine thrust-reversers and nacelles are supplied by US-based UTC Aerospace Systems.[183][184]
#Operational history
#Iberia received the 500th A350 on 30 September 2022
#
#One year after introduction, the A350 fleet had accumulated 3,000 flight cycles and around 16,000 block hours. Average daily usage by first customers was 11.4 hours with flights averaging 5.2 hours, which are under the aircraft's capabilities and reflect both short flights within the schedules of Qatar Airways and Vietnam Airlines, as well as flight-crew proficiency training that is typical of early use and is accomplished on short-haul flights. Finnair was operating the A350 at very high rates: 15 flight hours per day for Beijing, 18 hours for Shanghai, and more than 20 hours for Bangkok.[185] This may have accelerated the retirement of the Airbus A340.[185]
#
#In service, problems occurred in three areas. The onboard maintenance, repair, overhaul network needed software improvements. Airbus issued service bulletins regarding onboard equipment and removed galley inserts (coffee makers, toaster ovens) because of leaks. Airbus had to address spurious overheating warnings in the bleed air system by retrofitting an original connector with a gold-plated connector. Airbus targeted a 98.5% dependability by the end of 2016 and to match the mature A330 reliability by early 2019.[185]
#
#By the end of May 2016, the A350 fleet had flown 55,200 hours over 9,400 cycles at a 97.8% operational reliability on three months. The longest operated sector was Qatar Airways' Adelaide–Doha at 13.8 hours for 6,120 nmi (11,334 km; 7,043 mi). 45% of flights were under 3,000 nmi (5,556 km; 3,452 mi), 16% over 5,000 nmi (9,260 km; 5,754 mi), and 39% in between. The average flight was 6.8 hours, with the longest average being 9.6 hours by TAM Airlines and the shortest being 2.1 hours by Cathay Pacific's. It is able to seat from 253 seats for Singapore Airlines to 348 seats for TAM Airlines, with a 30 to 46 seat business class and a 211 to 318 seat economy class, often including a premium economy.[186] A total of 49 A350s were delivered to customers in 2016. It was also planned that the monthly rate would grow to 10 by the end of 2018, which was eventually achieved in 2019 when Airbus delivered 112 aircraft over a period of 11 months.[187][70]
#
#In January 2017, two years after introduction, 62 aircraft were in service with 10 airlines. They had accumulated 25,000 flights over 154,000 hours with an average daily utilisation of 12.5 hours, and transported six million passengers with a 98.7% operational reliability.[188] Zodiac Aerospace encountered production difficulties with business class seats in their Texas and California factories. After a year, Cathay Pacific experienced cosmetic quality issues and upgraded or replaced the seats for the earliest cabins.[189] In 2017, average test flights before delivery decreased to 4.1 from 12 in 2014, with an average delay down to 25 days from 68.[190] Its reliability was 97.2% in 2015, 98.3% in 2016, and 98.8% in June 2017, just behind its 99% target for 2017.[191]
#
#In June 2017 after 30 months in commercial operation, 80 A350s were in service with 12 operators, the largest being Qatar Airways with 17 and 13 each at Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines (SIA).[187] The fleet average block time (time between pushback and destination gate arrival) was 7.2 hours with 53% below 3,000 nmi (5,556 km; 3,452 mi), 16% over 5,000 nmi (9,260 km; 5,754 mi), and 31% in between. LATAM Airlines had the longest average sector at 10.7 hours, and Asiana had the shortest at 3.8 hours.[187] Singapore Airlines operated the longest leg, Singapore to San Francisco 7,340 nmi (13,594 km; 8,447 mi), and the shortest leg, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur 160 nmi (296 km; 184 mi).[187] Seating varied from 253 for Singapore Airlines to 389 for Air Caraïbes, with most between 280 and 320.[187]
#
#On 30 September 2022, the 500th A350, an A350-900, was delivered to Iberia.[130] As of August 2023, the global A350 fleet had 4.2 years average aircraft age, had completed more than 1,175,000 flights on more than 1070 routes, and had carried more than 305 million passengers since its entry into service; the fleet had 99.4 percent operational reliability in the last 3 months.[192]
#Qatar Airways paint dispute
#
#In August 2021, as several A350s were sent in to be repainted for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Qatar Airways discovered that their paint was unusually degraded. The airline grounded its airliners until the root cause could be determined, and would not accept deliveries until the problem could be solved.[193] The European regulator, EASA, found that paint degradation did not affect the aircraft structure or introduce "other risks".[194] Singapore Airlines had not detected such problems with its fleet.[195]
#
#In November 2021, Reuters found that Finnair, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Lufthansa and Air France had also complained of paint damage as early as 2016.[196] On 20 December 2021, Airbus received a formal legal claim in the English courts filed by Qatar Airways.[197] Qatar Airways alleged that the surface flaws cause the risk of fuel tank ignition due to the degradation in lightning protection over the fuel tanks in the wings.[198] The court hearing was originally scheduled for summer 2023.[199] Both Airbus and Qatar Airways agreed to settle the dispute on 1 February 2023.[200]
#
#The Qatar civil aviation regulator was the only one agreeing with the airline.[201] Qatar Airways was claiming a $200,000-per-day compensation for each grounded aircraft.[201] Airbus decided to cancel Qatar’s outstanding orders, showing that it was certain of its case.[201] While the settlement is confidential, Airbus may benefit more as there is no major impact to Airbus's finances, the A350 reputation remains intact and Qatar's A321neos will be delivered three years late, underlining their price was not renegotiated.[201]
#Variants
#Comparative lengths of the three variants, with the now-cancelled -800
#
#The three main variants of the A350 were launched in 2006, with entry into service planned for 2013.[26] At the 2011 Paris Air Show, Airbus postponed the entry into service of the A350-1000 by two years to mid-2017.[85] In July 2012, the A350's entry into service was delayed to the second half of 2014,[86] before the -900 began service on 15 January 2015.[2] In October 2012, the -800 was due to enter service in mid-2016,[202] but its development was cancelled in September 2014.[99] The A350 is also offered as the ACJ350 corporate jet by Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ), offering a 20,000 km; 12,400 mi (10,800 nmi) range for 25 passengers for the -900 derivative.[203]
#A350-900
#The baseline 67 m (219 ft) long A350-900
#
#The A350-900 is the first A350 model; it has a MTOW of 280 tonnes (620,000 lb),[204] typically seats 325 passengers, and has a range of 8,100 nmi (15,000 km; 9,300 mi).[205] Airbus says that per seat, the Boeing 777-200ER should have a 16% heavier manufacturer's empty weight, a 30% higher block fuel consumption, and 25% higher cash operating costs than the A350-900.[206] The −900 is designed to compete with the Boeing 777 and 787[207] (777-200LR, and 787-10), while replacing the Airbus A340-300 and A340-500.
#
#A proposed A350−900R extended-range variant was to feature the higher engine thrust, strengthened structure, and landing gear of the 308 tonnes (679,000 lb) MTOW -1000 to give a further 800 nmi (1,500 km; 920 mi) range.[208]
#
#Philippine Airlines (PAL) will replace its A340-300 with an A350-900HGW ("high-gross weight") variant available from 2017.[209] It will enable non-stop Manila-New York City flights without payload limitations in either direction,[210] a 7,404 nmi (13,712 km; 8,520 mi) flight.[211] The PAL version will have a 278 tonnes (613,000 lb) MTOW, and from 2020, the -900 will be proposed with the ULR's 280 tonnes (620,000 lb) MTOW, up from the 268 tonnes (591,000 lb) for the original weight variant and the certified 260, 272, and 275 tonnes (573,000, 600,000, and 606,000 lb) variants, with the large fuel capacity. This will enable an 8,100 nmi (15,000 km; 9,300 mi) range with 325 seats in a three-class layout.[212]
#
#In early November 2017, Emirates committed to purchase 40 Boeing 787-10 aircraft before Airbus presented an updated A350-900 layout with the rear pressure bulkhead pushed back by 2.5 ft (1 m).[213] After Emirates' Tim Clark was shown a ten-abreast economy cabin and galley changes, he said the -900 is "more marketable" as a result.[214]
#
#The average lease rates of the first A350-900s produced in 2014 were $1.1 million per month, not including maintenance reserves amounting to $18 million after 10–12 years, and falling to $940,000 per month in 2018 while a new A350-900 is leased for $1.2 million per month and its interior can cost $12 million, 10% of the aircraft.[215] By 2018, a 2014 build was valued $108M falling to $74.5M by 2022 while a new build was valued for $148M, a 6+12year check cost $3M and an engine overhaul $4–6.5M.[216]
#A350-900ULR
#Singapore Airlines A350-900ULR, externally identical to the regular A350-900
#
#The MTOW of the ultra-long range -900ULR has been increased to 280 t (620,000 lb) and its fuel capacity increased from 141,000 to 165,000 L (37,000 to 44,000 US gal) within existing fuel tanks, enabling up to 19-hour flights with a 9,700 nmi (18,000 km; 11,200 mi) range,[217] the longest range of any airliner in service as of 2022.[192] The MTOW is increased by 5 tonnes (11,000 lb) from the previously certified 275 tonnes (606,000 lb) variant.[204] Because of the A350-900's fuel consumption of 5.8 tonnes (13,000 lb) per hour, it needs an additional 24 tonnes (53,000 lb) of fuel to fly 19 hours instead of the standard 15 hours: the increased MTOW and lower payloads will enable the larger fuel capacity.[218] Non-stop flights could last more than 20 hours.[219] The first −900ULR was rolled out without its engines in February 2018 for ground testing. Flight-tests after engine installation checked the larger fuel capacity and measured the performance improvements from the extended winglets.[220] It made its first flight on 23 April 2018.[221]
#
#Singapore Airlines, the launch customer and currently the only operator, used its seven -900ULR aircraft on non-stop flights between Singapore and New York City and cities on the U.S. east coast.[222] Singapore Airlines' seating is to range from 170 in largely business class seating up to over 250 in mixed seating.[223] The planes can be reconfigured.[224] They will have two seating classes.[225] The airline received its first -900ULR on 23 September 2018, with 67 business class seats and 94 premium economy seats.[226] On 12 October 2018, it landed the world's then-longest flight at Newark Liberty International Airport from Singapore Changi after 17 hours and 52 minutes,[227] covering 16,561 kilometres (8,942 nmi; 10,291 mi) for a 15,353 kilometres (8,290 nmi; 9,540 mi) orthodromic distance.[228] It burned 101.4 t (224,000 lb) of fuel to cover the route in 17 h 22 min: an average of 5.8 tonnes per hour (1.6 kg/s).[229] As of 2022, the A350-900ULR is used on the longest flight in the world, Singapore Airlines Flights 23 and 24 from Singapore to New York JFK.
#
#At the 2015 Dubai Air Show, John Leahy noted the demand of the Persian Gulf airlines for this variant.[230] In February 2018, Qatar Airways stated its preference for the larger -1000, having no need for the extra range of the -900ULR.[231] Compared to the standard -900, the -900ULR additional value is likely around $2 million.[232]
#ACJ350
#ACJ350 of the German Air Force
#
#Airbus Corporate Jet version of the A350, the ACJ350, is derived from the A350-900ULR. As a result of the increased fuel capacity from the -900ULR, the ACJ350 has a maximum range of 20,000 km (10,800 nmi; 12,430 mi).[233] The German Air Force is to be the first to receive the ACJ350 having ordered 3 aircraft which will replace its 2 A340-300.[234]
#A350 Regional
#
#After the Boeing 787-10 launch at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Airbus discussed with airlines a possible A350-900 Regional with a reduced MTOW of 250 t (550,000 lb).[235] Engine thrust would have been reduced to 70,000–75,000 lbf (310–330 kN) from the standard 85,000 lbf (380 kN) and the variant would have been optimised for routes up to 6,800 nmi (12,600 km; 7,800 mi) with seating for up to 360 passengers in a single-class layout.[236] The A350 Regional was expected to be ordered by Etihad Airways[237] and Singapore Airlines.[238] Since 2013, there has been no further announcement about this variant.
#
#Singapore Airlines selected an A350-900 version for medium-haul use,[239] and Japan Airlines took delivery of a 369-seat A350-900 with a 217 t (478,000 lb) MTOW for its domestic flight network.[240] The A350 Type Certificate Data Sheet includes MTOWs of 217, 235, 240, 250, 255, 260, 268, 272, 275, 277, 278, 280 and 283 t.[112]
#A350-1000
#The 73.8 m (242 ft) long A350-1000 first flew on 24 November 2016.
#
#The A350-1000 is the largest variant of the A350 family at just under 74 metres (243 ft) in length. It seats 350-410 passengers in a typical three-class layout with a range of 8,700 nmi (16,100 km; 10,000 mi).[241] With a 9-abreast configuration, it is designed to replace the A340-600 and compete with the Boeing 777-300ER and 777-9. Airbus estimates a 366-seat -1000 should have a 35 tonnes (77,000 lb) lighter operating empty weight than a 398-seat 777-9, a 15% lower trip cost, a 7% lower seat cost, and a 400 nmi (740 km; 460 mi) greater range.[242] Compared to a Boeing 777-300ER with 360 seats, Airbus claims a 25% fuel burn per seat advantage for an A350-1000 with 369 seats.[243] The 7 m (23 ft) extension seats 40 more passengers with 40% more premium area.[160] The -1000 can match the 40 more seats of the 777-9 by going 10-abreast but with diminished comfort.[244]
#
#The A350-1000 has an 11-frame stretch over the −900 and a slightly larger wing than the −800/900 models with trailing-edge extension increasing its area by 4%. This will extend the high-lift devices and the ailerons, making the chord bigger by around 400 mm (16 in), optimising flap lift performance as well as cruise performance.[245] The main landing gear is a 6-wheel bogie instead of a 4-wheel bogie, put in a one frame longer bay. The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine's thrust is augmented to 97,000 lbf (430 kN).[246] These and other engineering upgrades are necessary so that the −1000 model maintains range.[247]
#Qatar Airways was the A350-1000 XWB launch operator in February 2018.
#
#It features an automatic emergency descent function to around 10,000 ft (3,000 m) and notifies air traffic control if the crew fails to respond to an alert, indicating possible incapacitation from depressurisation. The avionics software adaptation is activated by a push and pull button to avoid mistakes and could be retrofitted in the smaller -900.[248] All performance targets have been met or exceeded, and it remains within its weight specification, unlike early −900s.[113]
#
#Its basic 308 t (679,000 lb) MTOW was increased to 311 t (686,000 lb) before offering a possible 316 t (697,000 lb) version.[249] Its 316 t MTOW appeared on 29 May 2018 update of its type certificate data sheet.[112] This raised its range from 7,950 to 8,400 nmi (14,720 to 15,560 km; 9,150 to 9,670 mi).[250] A further MTOW increase by 3 t (6,600 lb), to a total of 319 t (703,000 lb) is under study to be available from 2020 and could be a response to Qantas' Project Sunrise.[251] Initial speculation suggested that the variant might be marketed as the A350-1000ULR.[252] However, the -1000 is not expected to share the -900ULR's larger fuel tanks and other fuel system modifications, and Airbus has stopped short of describing the largest MTOW variant as a ULR model, despite the 8,700 nmi (16,100 km; 10,000 mi) range.[253]
#
#In November 2019, maximum accommodation increased to 480 seats from 440 through the installation of new "Type-A+" exits, with a dual-lane evacuation slide.[254] On 17 December 2021, French Bee took delivery of the first A350-1000 in this 480-seat configuration, leased by Air Lease Corporation and to be operated by from Paris to Reunion Island, with 40 premium and 440 economy seats.[255]
#
#In December 2019, Qantas tentatively chose the A350-1000 to operate their Project Sunrise routes, before a final decision in March 2020 for up to 12 aircraft.[256] After a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the decision was confirmed on 2 May 2022, when Qantas placed a formal order for 12 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft for Project Sunrise flights to start in 2025.[257] The aircraft will be configured with 238 seats in four classes.[258]
#
#In October 2023, its MTOW was raised again to 322 t (710,000 lb).[259]
#A350F
#The 70.8 m (232 ft) long A350F, with an aft cargo door
#
#An A350-900 freighter was first mentioned in 2007, offering a similar capacity to the MD-11F with a range of 9,250 km (5,000 nmi; 5,750 mi), to be developed after the passenger version.[260] In early 2020, Airbus was proposing an A350F before a potential launch.[261] The proposed freighter would be slightly longer than the A350-900 and Airbus would need 50 orders to launch the $2–3 billion programme.[262] In July 2021, the Airbus board approved the freighter development.[263] It is based on the -1000 version for a payload over 90 tonnes, and entry into service is targeted for 2025.[264]
#
#The A350F would keep the A350-1000 319 t MTOW, shortened but still 6.9 m (23 ft) longer than the Boeing 777F for 10% larger freight volume at 695 m3 (24,500 cu ft) compared to 633 m3 (22,400 cu ft) for the 777F, similar to the Boeing 747-8F.[265] With a maindeck cargo door behind the wing and reinforced main deck aluminum floor beams, its 111 t (245,000 lb) payload is higher than the 103.7 t (229,000 lb) of the 777F, while its empty weight is 30 t (66,000 lb) lighter than the A350-1000, 20 t (44,000 lb) lighter than the 777F.[265] At the November 2021 Dubai Air Show, US lessor Air Lease Corporation became the launch customer with an order for seven to be delivered around 2026, among other Airbus airliners.[266] The launch operator of the A350F will be Singapore Airlines, who ordered 7 aircraft at the 2022 Singapore Airshow,[267] with deliveries to start in 2026.[citation needed] The 70.8 m (232 ft) long cargo variant should have a 4,700 nmi (8,700 km; 5,400 mi) range at max payload.[268] By May 2023, planned entry-into-service slipped to 2026.[269]

#Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the
#supremacy of God and the rule of law:
#Guarantee of Rights
#and Freedoms
#1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees
#the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
#prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
#society.
#Fundamental Freedoms
#2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: (a) freedom
#of conscience and religion; (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and
#expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;
#(c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and (d) freedom of association.
#Democratic Rights
#3. Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of
#members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be
#qualified for membership therein. 4.(1) No House of Commons and no
#legislative assembly shall continue for longer than five years from the date
#fixed for the return of the writs at a general election of its members. (2) In time
#of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, a House of Commons
#may be continued by Parliament and a legislative assembly may be continued
#by the legislature beyond five years if such continuation is not opposed by
#the votes of more than one-third of the members of the House of Commons
#or the legislative assembly, as the case may be. 5. There shall be a sitting of
#Parliament and of each legislature at least once every twelve months.
#Mobility Rights
#6.(1) Every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and
#leave Canada. (2) Every citizen of Canada and every person who has the status
#of a permanent resident of Canada has the right (a) to move to and take up
#residence in any province; and (b) to pursue the gaining of a livelihood in
#any province. (3) The rights specified in subsection (2) are subject to (a)
#any laws or practices of general application in force in a province other than
#those that discriminate among persons primarily on the basis of province
#of present or previous residence; and (b) any laws providing for reasonable
#residency requirements as a qualification for the receipt of publicly provided
#social services. (4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not preclude any law, program
#or activity that has as its object the amelioration in a province of conditions of
#individuals in that province who are socially or economically disadvantaged
#if the rate of employment in that province is below the rate of employment in
#Canada.
#Legal Rights
#7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and
#the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles
#of fundamental justice. 8. Everyone has the right to be secure against
#unreasonable search or seizure. 9. Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily
#detained or imprisoned. 10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention (a)
#to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; (b) to retain and instruct
#counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; and (c) to have
#the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be
#released if the detention is not lawful. 11. Any person charged with an offence
#has the right (a) to be informed without unreasonable delay of the specific
#offence; (b) to be tried within a reasonable time; (c) not to be compelled to
#be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the offence; (d)
#to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and
#public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal; (e) not to be denied
#reasonable bail without just cause; (f) except in the case of an offence under
#military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury
#where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five
#years or a more severe punishment; (g) not to be found guilty on account of
#any act or omission unless, at the time of the act or omission, it constituted
#an offence under Canadian or international law or was criminal according to
#the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations; (h) if
#finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally found
#guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again;
#and (i) if found guilty of the offence and if the punishment for the offence has
#been varied between the time of commission and the time of sentencing, to the
#benefit of the lesser punishment. 12. Everyone has the right not to be subjected
#to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. 13. A witness who testifies
#in any proceedings has the right not to have any incriminating evidence so
#given used to incriminate that witness in any other proceedings, except in a
#prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence. 14. A party
#or witness in any proceedings who does not understand or speak the language
#in which the proceedings are conducted or who is deaf has the right to the
#assistance of an interpreter.
#Equality Rights
#15.(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and
#has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without
#discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race,
#national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical
#disability. (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity
#that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged
#individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race,
#national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical
#disability.
#Official Languages
#of Canada
#16.(1) English and French are the official languages of Canada and
#have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all
#institutions of the Parliament and government of Canada. (2) English and
#French are the official languages of New Brunswick and have equality of
#status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the
#legislature and government of New Brunswick. (3) Nothing in this Charter
#limits the authority of Parliament or a legislature to advance the equality of
#status or use of English and French. 16.1(1) The English linguistic community
#and the French linguistic community in New Brunswick have equality of status
#and equal rights and privileges, including the right to distinct educational
#institutions and such distinct cultural institutions as are necessary for
#the preservation and promotion of those communities. (2) The role of the
#legislature and government of New Brunswick to preserve and promote the
#status, rights and privileges referred to in subsection (1) is affirmed. 17.(1)
#Everyone has the right to use English or French in any debates and other
#proceedings of Parliament. (2) Everyone has the right to use English or French
#in any debates and other proceedings of the legislature of New Brunswick.18.
#(1) The statutes, records and journals of Parliament shall be printed and
#published in English and French
#and both language versions are
#equally authoritative. (2) The
#statutes, records and journals of
#the legislature of New Brunswick
#shall be printed and published
#in English and French and both
#language versions are equally
#authoritative.19.(1) Either English or French may be used by any person
#in, or in any pleading in or process issuing from, any court established by
#Parliament. (2) Either English or French may be used by any person in, or in
#any pleading in or process issuing from, any court of New Brunswick. 20.(1)
#Any member of the public in Canada has the right to communicate with, and
#to receive available services from, any head or central office of an institution
#of the Parliament or government of Canada in English or French, and has the
#same right with respect to any other office of any such institution where (a)
#there is a significant demand for communications with and services from that
#office in such language; or (b) due to the nature of the office, it is reasonable
#that communications with and services from that office be available in both
#English and French. (2) Any member of the public in New Brunswick has the
#right to communicate with, and to receive available services from, any office
#of an institution of the legislature or government of New Brunswick in English
#or French. 21. Nothing in sections 16 to 20 abrogates or derogates from any
#right, privilege or obligation with respect to the English and French languages,
#or either of them, that exists or is continued by virtue of any other provision
#of the Constitution of Canada.22. Nothing in sections 16 to 20 abrogates or
#derogates from any legal or customary right or privilege acquired or enjoyed
#either before or after the coming into force of this Charter with respect to any
#language that is not English or French.
#Minority Language
#Educational Rights
#23.(1) Citizens of Canada (a) whose first language learned and still
#understood is that of the English or French linguistic minority population
#of the province in which they reside, or (b) who have received their primary
#school instruction in Canada in English or French and reside in a province
#where the language in which they received that instruction is the language of
#the English or French linguistic minority population of the province, have the
#right to have their children receive primary and secondary school instruction
#in that language in that province. (2) Citizens of Canada of whom any child
#has received or is receiving primary or secondary school instruction in English
#or French in Canada, have the right to have all their children receive primary
#and secondary school instruction in the same language. (3) The right of
#citizens of Canada under subsections (1) and (2) to have their children receive
#primary and secondary school instruction in the language of the English
#or French linguistic minority population of a province (a) applies wherever
#in the province the number of children of citizens who have such a right is
#sufficient to warrant the provision to them out of public funds of minority
#language instruction; and (b)
#includes, where the number of
#those children so warrants, the
#right to have them receive that
#instruction in minority language
#educational facilities provided out
#of public funds.
#Enforcement
#24.(1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this
#Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent
#jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just
#in the circumstances. (2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1),a court
#concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any
#rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if
#it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it
#in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
#General
#25. The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms
#shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal,
#treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of
#Canada including (a) any rights or freedoms that have been recognized by
#the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763; and (b) any rights or freedoms
#that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired. 26.
#The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be
#construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in
#Canada. 27. This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
#preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians. 28.
#Notwithstanding anything in this Charter, the rights and freedoms referred to
#in it are guaranteed equally to male and female persons. 29. Nothing in this
#Charter abrogates or derogates from any rights or privileges guaranteed by
#or under the Constitution of Canada in respect of denominational, separate
#or dissentient schools. 30. A reference in this Charter to a province or to the
#legislative assembly or legislature of a province shall be deemed to include
#a reference to the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories, or to the
#appropriate legislative authority thereof, as the case may be. 31. Nothing in this

#WHAT IS THE LAW?
#The law affects nearly every aspect
#of our lives every day. We have laws
#to deal with crimes like robbery
#and murder. And we have laws that
#govern activities like driving a car,
#getting a job, and getting married.
#Laws give us rules of conduct that
#protect everyone’s rights.
#The rule of law, freedom under
#the law, democratic principles, and
#respect for others form the founda-
#tions of Canada’s legal heritage.
#Every Canadian should understand
#the law, and the ideas and principles
#behind it. This publication will help
#readers understand
#• what the law is;
#• where it comes from;
#• what it is for; and
#• how it operates.
#Laws also balance individual rights
#with our obligations as members
#of society. For example, when a law
#gives a person a legal right to drive,
#it also makes it a duty for a driver to
#know how to drive and to follow the
#rules of the road.
#Why We Need Laws
#Laws are rules made by government
#that forbid certain actions and are
#enforced by the courts. Laws apply to
#everyone equally. If you
#break a law, you may
#have to pay a fine, pay
#for the damage you have
#done, or go to jail.
#Imagine the chaos –
#and the danger –
#if there were no laws.
#The strongest people
#would be in control and
#people would live in fear. Drivers
#could choose which side of the street
#to drive on and no one could stop
#them. Imagine trying to buy and sell
#goods if no one had to keep promises.
#Or trying to hold onto your personal
#property or even to keep yourself safe
#if there were no laws against robbery
#or assault.
#Even in a well-ordered society, people
#disagree, and conflicts arise. The law
#provides a way to resolve disputes
#peacefully. If two people claim the
#same piece of property, rather than
#fight they turn to the law. The courts
#The law provides
#a way to resolve
#disputes
#peacefully.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E2
#can decide who the real owner is and
#how to protect the owner’s rights.
#Laws help to ensure a safe and
#peaceful society. The Canadian legal
#system respects individual rights and
#ensures that our society is orderly.
#It applies the same law to everybody.
#This includes the police, governments
#and public officials. All of them must
#carry out their duties according to
#the law.
#What Other Goals Do
#Laws Achieve?
#In Canada, laws also carry out social
#policies. Laws allow systems to be put
#in place for governments
#to provide, for example,
#• benefits when workers
#are injured on the job;
#• insurance when
#workers are
#unemployed;
#• health care; and
#• loans to students.
#Our laws also recognize
#and protect basic
#individual rights and
#freedoms, such as liberty
#and equality. This helps prevent
#stronger groups and individuals from
#taking unfair advantage of weaker
#groups or people.
#Public Law and Private Law
#Laws can be divided into public law
#and private law.
#Public law sets the rules for the
#relationship between the individual
#and society. If someone breaks a
#criminal law, it is seen as a wrong
#against society. It includes
#• criminal law, which deals with
#crimes and their punishments;
#• constitutional law, which defines
#the relationship between various
#branches of government, as well
#as between federal and provincial
#governments; it also limits the
#exercise of governmental power
#over individuals through the
#protection of human rights and
#fundamental freedoms;
#• administrative law, which deals
#with the actions and operations
#of government.
#If someone runs away from a store
#with unpaid goods, that’s theft.
#It violates public law because it affects
#Our laws also
#recognize and
#protect basic
#individual rights
#and freedoms,
#such as liberty
#and equality.

#other people. If you back up your
#car into somebody’s fence, you could
#be violating their right to enjoy
#their property. That falls under
#private law.
#Private law sets the rules between
#individuals. It is also called civil law.
#Private law settles disputes among
#groups of people and compensates
#victims, as in the example of the
#fence. A civil case is an action that
#settles private disputes.

#Canada’s legal system is based on
#a combination of common law
#and civil law.
#The Common-Law Tradition
#The common law is law that is not
#written down as legislation. Common
#law evolved into a system of rules
#based on precedent. This is a rule that
#guides judges in making later deci-
#sions in similar cases. The common
#law cannot be found in any code or
#body of legislation, but
#only in past decisions.
#At the same time, it is
#flexible. It adapts to
#changing circumstanc-
#es because judges can
#announce new legal
#doctrines or change
#old ones.
#The Civil-Law Tradition
#Civil codes contain a comprehensive
#statement of rules. Many are framed
#as broad, general principles to deal
#with any dispute that may arise.
#Unlike common-law courts, courts in
#a civil-law system first look to a civil
#code, then refer to previous decisions
#to see if they’re consistent.
#Quebec is the only province with
#a civil code, which is based on the
#French Code Napoléon (Napoleonic
#Code). The rest of Canada uses the
#common law. The Criminal Code is
#also considered a code, and it is used
#throughout Canada.
#Aboriginal and Treaty Rights
#Aboriginal rights refer to Aboriginal
#peoples’ historical occupancy and use
#of the land. Treaty rights are rights
#DID YOU KNOW?
#Canada’s legal system is based on the English and French systems.
#Explorers and colonists brought these systems to Canada in the
#17th and 18th centuries. After the Battle of Quebec in 1759, the country
#fell under English common law, except for Quebec, which follows
#civil law.
#Quebec is the only
#province with a
#civil code.
#WHERE OUR LEGAL SYSTEM COMES FROM
#5C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#set out in treaties entered into by
#the Crown and a particular group of
#Aboriginal people. The Constitution
#recognizes and protects Aboriginal
#rights and treaty rights.
#How Parliament Makes Laws
#Democratic countries have a legisla-
#ture or parliament, with the power to
#make new laws or change old ones.
#Canada is a federation – a union of
#several provinces and territories with
#a central government. So it has both
#a federal parliament in Ottawa to
#make laws for all of Canada and a
#legislature in each of the ten provinces
#and three territories that deals with
#laws in their areas. Laws enacted at
#either level are called
#statutes, legislation, or
#acts. When Parliament
#or a provincial or terri-
#torial legislature passes
#a statute, it takes the
#place of common law or
#precedents dealing with
#the same subject.
#Making laws this way can
#be complicated. Let’s use
#an example to explain
#how it works. Suppose the federal
#government wanted to create a law
#that would help control pollution.
#1. Government ministers or senior
#public servants examine the
#problem carefully and suggest
#ways in which, under federal
#jurisdiction, a law could deal
#with pollution.
#2. They would draft the proposed law.
#The Two Meanings
#of Civil Law
#The term “civil law” is used to mean
#two quite different things, which
#can be a little confusing at first for
#people trying to understand the
#justice system. Sometimes the term
#is used in contrast to “common law”
#to refer to the legal system that is
#based on a civil code, such as the
#Justinian Code or the Civil Code
#of Quebec. In its other sense, civil
#law refers to matters of private
#law as opposed to public law, and
#particularly criminal law, which is
#concerned with harm to society
#at large. It is usually clear from the
#context which type of civil law
#is intended.
#The Constitution
#recognizes and
#protects Aboriginal
#rights and treaty
#rights.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E6
#3. The law has to be approved by
#the cabinet, which is traditionally
#made up of members of Parliament
#chosen by the prime minister.
#4. This version is then presented to
#Parliament as a bill to be studied
#and debated by members.
#5. The bill becomes law if it is
#approved by a majority in both
#the House of Commons and the
#Senate. It also needs to be assent-
#ed to by the Governor General in
#the name of the Queen. All laws
#need royal assent.
#Every province uses a similar process.
#The Lieutenant Governor of each
#province gives royal assent for laws
#passed by provincial legislatures.
#Judges develop common law by
#referring to and setting precedents.
#They also interpret and apply statutes.
#What Are Regulations?
#Because our society is so complex,
#more laws are being enacted today
#than ever before. If our lawmakers
#had to deal with all the details of all
#the laws, the task would be nearly
#impossible. To solve this problem,
#Parliament and provincial and territorial
#legislatures often pass laws to give
#departments or other government
#organizations the authority to make
#specific laws called regulations.
#Regulations carry out the purposes
#of the general laws or expand on
#them. They have the force of a law.
#For example, there are regulations
#that keep our food safe or outline
#what kind of storage tank to use for
#oil products.
#KEEPING THE LAWS UP TO DATE7
#Law Reform
#Every day, we hear about social issues,
#medical developments, and new types
#of technology. All of these raise moral
#and legal questions. These kinds of
#changes mean we need to constantly
#reform our laws so we can make sure
#that our system of law and justice
#meets the challenges of our society.
#As our society grows and develops,
#it cannot rely entirely on tradition.
#Sometimes new laws are needed or
#old laws need to be changed.
#As people change the way they live
#and work, some laws may become
#obsolete. Or new situations may arise
#that no existing law deals with.
#For example, old laws against theft
#did not foresee identity theft or online
#harassment. The same technology that
#enables one person to find informa-
#tion about another also makes it
#possible to steal information that
#was meant to be private.
#Alternative Approaches to Laws
#We may even need to change the
#system of law and justice itself.
#In our court system, it can take years
#to settle disputes. People can settle
#disputes by using less formal
#methods. Some informal mediation
#methods, such as alternative dispute
#resolution and landlord-tenant
#disputes, are already being used.
#Aboriginal customs and traditions
#have also contributed to new ways of
#dealing with people, such as healing
#and sentencing circles, community
#justice, and restorative
#justice.
#The Aboriginal Justice
#Strategy (AJS) is a way
#of diverting low-risk
#non-violent offenders
#from mainstream justice
#to restorative justice.
#As a result, offenders
#don’t get a criminal
#record, they can instead
#make amends to their
#community, and funds
#and resources are freed
#up to deal with more
#serious offences.
#The goals of the AJS are
#• to give Aboriginal people a greater
#role in administering justice in
#their communities;
#• to help decrease the rates of victim-
#ization, crime, and imprisonment
#among Aboriginal people;
#• to provide better and more timely
#information about community
#We need to
#constantly reform
#our laws so we can
#make sure that our
#system of law and
#justice meets the
#challenges of
#our society.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E8
#justice programs funded by the
#AJS; and
#• to reflect and include Aboriginal
#values within the justice system.
#Changing Laws

#constantly examining our laws and
#looking for ways to improve them.
#Law reform committees also review
#laws and recommend changes.

#court to create change. Social action
#groups seek changes to laws that
#they consider unfair to members of
#Canadian society. Industry groups
#and other stakeholders meet with
#government decision makers in an
#effort to present their opinions on the
#direction of public policy. Legislators
#in the federal, provincial, and
#territorial governments respond by
#introducing new laws or changing
#old ones.
#Ultimately, though, it is the people
#of Canada who elect the lawmakers.
#We as Canadians need to decide
#what we want from the law and then
#make sure it reflects those wishes.
#Everyone has the right to work

#A constitution provides the fundamental
#rules and principles that govern
#a country. It creates many of the insti-
#tutions and branches of government,
#and defines their powers.
#The Constitution of Canada includes
#the Constitution Act, 1867, and the
#Constitution Act, 1982. It is the
#supreme law of Canada. It reaffirms
#Canada’s dual legal system and
#also includes Aboriginal rights and
#treaty rights.
#What Does Our Constitution Say?
#The Constitution sets out the basic
#principles of democratic government
#in Canada when it defines the powers
#of the three branches of government:
#• the executive
#• the legislative
#• the judiciary
#The Queen has the executive power
#in Canada, but in our democratic
#society the Queen’s powers are
#exercised by constitutional convention
#on the advice of Ministers who enjoy
#the confidence of the House of
#Commons. Together, the Prime
#Minister and other Ministers form
#the cabinet, which is responsible to
#Parliament for government business.
#Ministers are also responsible for
#government departments, such as
#the Department of Finance and the
#Department of Justice. When we say
#“the government,” we are usually
#referring to the executive branch.
#Parliament is the legislative branch
#of the federal government. Parliament
#consists of the Queen (who is
#usually represented by the Governor
#General), the Senate and the House
#of Commons. Bills are debated and
#passed by the Senate and the House
#of Commons. The Governor General
#must also give royal assent to a bill
#THE CANADIAN CONSTITUTION
#DID YOU KNOW?
#Canada was created by an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom
#called the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act,
#1867), uniting the British colonies of the United Province of Canada, Nova
#Scotia, and New Brunswick.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E10
#in order for it to become a law.
#By constitutional convention, royal
#assent is always given to bills passed
#by the Senate and the House of
#Commons.
#Our Constitution also includes
#provisions relating to the judicial
#branch of government, composed of
#judges. The judiciary must interpret
#and apply the law and the Constitu-
#tion, and give impartial
#judgments in all cases,
#whether they involve
#public law, such as a
#criminal case, or private
#law, such as a dispute
#over a contract.
#The Constitution only
#provides for federally
#appointed judges.
#Provincial judges are appointed under
#provincial laws.
#What is a Federal System?
#The Parliament of Canada and the
#provincial and territorial legislatures
#both have the authority or jurisdic-
#tion to make laws. Parliament can
#make laws for all of Canada, but
#only about matters the Constitution
#assigns to it. A provincial or
#territorial legislature can only
#make laws about matters within
#the province’s borders.
#The federal Parliament deals mainly
#with issues that concern Canada as
#a whole: trade between provinces,
#national defence, criminal law,
#money, patents, and the postal
#service. It is also responsible for
#DID YOU KNOW?
#The Constitution was “patriated” from the United Kingdom in 1982.
#When Canada was created, it was a self-governing British colony. The British
#North America Act, 1867 codified many constitutional rules for Canada,
#but major changes to the Constitution could only be made by the United
#Kingdom Parliament. In 1982, the Charter was enacted as part of Canada’s
#Constitution along with a set of procedures allowing the Constitution to be
#amended in Canada.
#Parliament is the

#of the federal
#government.

#the three territories: Yukon, the
#Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.
#Federal law allows territories to elect
#councils with powers like those of
#the provincial legislatures.
#The provinces have the authority to
#make laws about education, property,
#civil rights, the administration of
#justice, hospitals, municipalities, and
#other local or private matters within
#the provinces.
#There are also local or municipal
#governments. They are created under
#provincial laws and can make bylaws
#that regulate a variety of local matters:
#zoning, smoking,
#pesticide use, parking,
#business regulations, and
#construction permits.
#Aboriginal peoples in
#Canada have different
#types of government.
#For example, First
#Nations can have a range
#of governmental powers
#over reserve lands under
#the federal Indian Act.
#Other Aboriginal
#governments, such as
#self-governments,
#exercise these powers as
#a result of agreements
#they have negotiated
#with the federal and
#provincial or territorial
#governments.
#The Constitution Act includes protec-
#tion for the rights of the Aboriginal
#peoples (Indian, Inuit, and Métis)
#of Canada. Section 35 of the
#Constitution Act recognizes and
#affirms Aboriginal rights, which are
#rights related to the historical occu-
#pancy and use of the land by Aboriginal
#peoples. This is to help Aboriginal
#peoples preserve their customs and
#traditions for future generations,
#as continuing cultural practices.
#It was only with
#the Canadian
#Charter of Rights
#and Freedoms
#that human
#rights in Canada
#were protected
#in the written
#Constitution.
#The Department of Justice
#The Minister of Justice is responsi-
#ble for the Department of Justice,
#which provides legal services such
#as drafting laws and providing
#legal advice to the government
#and its departments. The depart-
#ment also develops criminal law
#and public law, as well as policies
#and programs for victims, families,
#children and youth criminal justice.
#The Minister of Justice is also the
#Attorney General or chief law
#officer of Canada.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E12
#Section 35 also recognizes and affirms
#treaty rights, which are specifically
#set out in agreements between the
#Crown and particular groups of
#Aboriginal people.
#Bijuralism
#Canada is a bijural country – that
#means it has both common and civil
#law systems. Matters of private law in
#Quebec are governed by the civil law,
#while the common law applies in the
#other provinces. Federal bills and
#regulations must respect both types
#of systems, and the legal concepts
#within these laws must be expressed
#in both English and French.
#DID YOU KNOW?
#The Constitution Act, 1867 authorized Parliament to establish a general court
#of appeal for Canada, as well as any additional courts to better administer
#the laws of Canada. It was under this authority that the Federal Courts, the
#Tax Court, and the Supreme Court of Canada were established.
#Other Federal Systems
#Australia and the United States
#also have federal systems where
#jurisdiction is divided between
#the federal government and the
#various states. In contrast, the
#United Kingdom has a unitary
#system where there is only one

#RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN CANADA
#In Canada, the Constitution, as well
#as federal, provincial and territorial
#laws, protect our human rights and
#fundamental freedoms.
#The Canadian Bill of Rights, passed
#in 1960, was the first federal human
#rights law in Canada. It guarantees
#many basic rights and freedoms,
#including the “right of the individual
#to life, liberty, security of the person
#and enjoyment of property” and the
#right not to be deprived of any of
#those rights except in accordance
#with “due process,” meaning basic
#procedural fairness.
#The Canadian Human Rights Act,
#passed in 1977, also protects human
#rights in the federal public and
#private sectors (for example, banking,
#rail, telecommunications, inter-
#provincial transportation),
#particularly the right to equality
#and non-discrimination in the areas
#of employment, housing and the
#provision of services.
#All provinces and territories also
#have human rights legislation which
#prohibits discrimination in employ-
#ment, housing and in providing
#goods, services, and facilities to the
#public. Some provincial and territorial
#laws protect a broader range of rights
#and freedoms. But like any legislation,
#these laws can be repealed or changed,
#so their protection can be limited.
#It was only with the Canadian Charter
#of Rights and Freedoms that human
#rights in Canada were protected in
#the written Constitution.
#What Does the Canadian Charter
#of Rights and Freedoms Say?
#The Constitution says that the
#Charter takes priority over all other
#legislation in Canada because it is
#part of the “supreme law
#of Canada.” It applies to
#all government action,
#meaning to the provincial
#legislatures and Parlia-
#ment, and to everything
#done under their
#authority. This means
#that governments must
#take the Charter into
#account in developing
#all laws and policies. It
#also means that when an
#individual goes to court
#because he or she
#believes that Parliament
#or a legislature or a
#government official
#has violated rights or
#fundamental freedoms guaranteed
#in the Charter, the court may declare
#The interests of
#society must always
#be balanced against
#the interests of
#individuals to see
#if limits on
#individual rights
#can be justified.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E14
#the law invalid if it conflicts with
#the Charter or provide any other
#“appropriate and just” remedy.
#However, section 1 of the Charter also
#recognizes that even in a democracy,
#rights and freedoms are not absolute.
#For example, no one is free to yell
#“fire” in a crowded theatre, to slander
#someone, to engage in religious
#practices which cause harm to others,
#to spread child pornography or hate
#propaganda or to enter or leave
#Canada without any restrictions
#whatsoever. Parliament or a provincial
#legislature can limit fundamental
#rights, but only if it can show that
#the limit
#• is set out in a law;
#• pursues an important goal which
#can be justified in a free and
#democratic society; and
#• pursues that goal in a reasonable
#and proportionate manner.
#The interests of society must always
#be balanced against the interests
#of individuals to see if limits on
#individual rights can be justified.
#The Charter also affirms that we are
#a multicultural country and that
#the Charter must be interpreted
#consistently with this ideal.
#Under the Constitution, both
#Parliament and the provincial legisla-
#tures still have a limited power to pass
#laws that may violate certain Charter
#rights. However, this can only be
#done if Parliament or a provincial
#legislature specifically declare that it
#is passing a law notwithstanding
#certain provisions of the Charter.
#This declaration must be reviewed
#and re-enacted at least every five
#years or it will not remain in force.
#The declaration informs Canadians
#of the limits being imposed on
#Charter-protected rights or freedoms.
#It also requires the government to
#explain itself, to accept full responsi-
#bility for its actions, and to take the
#political consequences. So far,
#Parliament has never used the
#notwithstanding clause.
#What Rights Does the
#Charter Protect?
#The Charter protects
#• fundamental freedoms
#• democratic rights
#• mobility rights
#• legal rights
#• equality rights
#• language rights
#15C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#It also recognizes and affirms
#Aboriginal and treaty rights.
#Fundamental freedoms
#• Everyone in Canada is free to
#practise any religion or no
#religion at all.
#• We are free to think our own
#thoughts, speak our minds,
#to gather peacefully into groups
#and to associate with whomever we
#wish, as long as we do not infringe
#valid laws which protect the rights
#and interests of others.
#• The media are free to print and
#broadcast news and other informa-
#tion, subject only to reasonable and
#justifiable limits set out in law.
#Democratic rights
#• Every Canadian citizen has the
#right to vote in elections for
#Members of Parliament and
#representatives in provincial and
#territorial legislatures, and to seek
#election themselves, subject to
#certain limited exceptions (for
#example, minimum voting age),
#which have been found to be
#reasonable and justifiable.
#• Our elected governments
#cannot hold power indefinitely.
#The Charter requires governments
#to call an election at least once
#every five years. The only exception
#is in a national emergency, such as
#war, if two-thirds of the Members
#of the House of Commons or a
#legislative assembly agree to delay
#the election.
#• Every citizen has the right to have
#their elected representatives sit
#at least once a year in Parliament
#and legislatures, so Parliament and
#government are held to account.
#Mobility rights
#• Canadian citizens have the right
#to enter, remain in, or leave
#the country.
#• Canadian citizens and permanent
#residents have the right to live or
#seek work anywhere in Canada.
#Governments in Canada can’t
#discriminate on the basis of some-
#one’s current or previous province
#of residence. For example, if a
#person is a qualified professional,
#such as an accountant, in one
#province, another province cannot
#prevent him or her from working
#there because that person does not
#live there.
#• However, laws can set reasonable
#residency requirements for certain
#social and welfare benefits. Provinces
#with an employment rate below the
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E16
#national average may also set up
#programs for socially and economi-
#cally disadvantaged residents,
#without having to extend them
#to non-residents.
#Legal rights
#• The Charter also protects the basic
#human rights to life, liberty and
#physical and psychological safety
#(or “security of the person”).
#• No one can be deprived of these
#rights except through fair legal
#procedures and based on clear,
#fair laws.
#• The right to be presumed innocent
#until proven guilty is a basic
#constitutional guarantee.
#• The Charter also protects everyone’s
#reasonable expectation of privacy
#in their homes, private spaces and
#personal information. This includes
#protection against unreasonable
#searches and seizures by police and
#other government authorities,
#who generally need a judge-
#approved warrant to enter your
#home or take other actions which
#interfere with your privacy.
#• Everyone is also protected
#against being detained or arrested
#arbitrarily. A police officer must
#have reasonable grounds to believe
#that you have committed a crime
#before holding you in custody.
#The right to challenge the legality
#of your detention (also called
#“habeas corpus”) is expressly
#guaranteed in the Charter.
#• The Charter also protects against
#random or arbitrary actions by law
#enforcement agencies. For example,
#you have the right to be told why
#you are being arrested or detained,
#to consult a lawyer without delay,
#to be informed of this right, and
#to have a court determine quickly
#whether this detention is lawful.
#• Everyone has the right not to be
#subjected to any cruel and unusual
#punishment, including torture,
#excessive or abusive use of force
#by law enforcement officials and
#sentences of imprisonment which
#are “grossly disproportionate”
#to the seriousness of the crime
#committed.
#• If you are charged with an offence
#under federal or provincial law
#you also have the right:
#– to be told promptly of the
#offence;
#– to be tried within a reasonable
#time;
#– not to be compelled to testify
#at your own trial;
#17C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#– to be presumed innocent until
#proven guilty beyond a reasonable
#doubt in a fair and public hearing
#by an independent and impartial
#tribunal;
#– not to be denied reasonable bail
#without cause;
#– to be tried by a jury for serious
#charges;
#– to be convicted only for an act
#or omission that was a crime at
#the time it was committed;
#– not to be tried or punished twice
#for the same offence;
#– to the benefit of the lesser
#punishment if the punishment
#for a crime changes between the
#time you committed the offence
#and the time you are sentenced;
#• Everyone has the right, as a witness
#in legal proceedings, not to have
#any incriminating evidence you
#give used against you in later
#proceedings, unless you are charged
#with perjury (lying during legal
#proceedings).
#• Everyone has a right to an inter-
#preter in legal proceedings if you
#do not understand the language or
#are hearing-impaired.
#Equality rights
#• Equality rights are at
#the core of the Charter.
#They are intended to
#ensure that everyone is
#treated with the same
#respect, dignity and
#consideration (i.e.
#without discrimina-
#tion), regardless of
#personal characteristics
#such as race, national or
#ethnic origin, colour,
#religion, sex, age, or
#mental or physical
#disability, sexual
#orientation, marital
#status or citizenship.
#• This usually means that everyone
#should be treated the same by law
#and that everyone is entitled to the
#same benefits provided by laws or
#government policies. However,
#the Charter does not require that
#government always treat people in
#exactly the same way. For example,
#sometimes protecting equality
#means that rules or standards must
#be reasonably adapted to take
#account of people’s differences,
#including by allowing people to
#observe different religious holidays
#without losing their job, or putting
#specific supports in place to enable
#Everyone, regardless
#of race, national
#or ethnic origin,
#colour, religion, sex,
#age, or mental or
#physical disability,
#is equal before
#the law.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E18
#people with visual disabilities or
#hearing impairments to access
#government services.
#• It is also constitutional to create
#special programs aimed at improving
#the situation of individuals who
#are members of groups that have
#historically experienced discrimina-
#tion in Canada, including
#on the basis of the
#grounds listed above.
#Language rights
#English and French
#are Canada’s official
#languages, according
#to the Charter. Both
#languages have equality
#of status and equal rights
#and privileges to be
#used in all institutions
#of Parliament and
#government of Canada.
#• Everyone has the right to use
#English or French in any
#debates and other proceedings
#of Parliament.
#• The statutes, records and journals
#of Parliament must be printed
#and published in both languages
#and both language versions have
#equal authority.
#• Everyone has the right to use
#English or French in proceedings
#before any court established by
#Parliament.
#• Members of the public have a right
#to communicate with and receive
#services in English or French from
#any head office of an institution of
#Parliament or government of
#Canada. They have this same right
#from any office of an institution
#where there is a significant demand.
#Depending on the nature of the
#office, it might also be reasonable
#that communications and services
#be available in both English
#and French.
#• Similar rights apply in New Bruns-
#wick, the only officially bilingual
#province in Canada. In fact, people
#in New Brunswick have the right to
#communicate and obtain services
#in either English or French from
#any office of an institution of the
#legislature or government of New
#Brunswick. Under section 16 of the
#Charter, the English and French
#linguistic communities in New
#Brunswick also have equality of
#status and equal rights and privileges,
#including the right to distinct
#educational institutions and
#cultural institutions that are needed
#to preserve and promote those
#communities.
#Everyone has
#the right to use
#English or French
#in the debates and
#proceedings of
#Parliament.
#19C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#• The Constitution Act, 1867 and the
#Manitoba Act also grants people in
#Quebec and Manitoba the right to
#use English and French in debates
#and proceedings of the legislatures
#and the courts of those provinces.
#These provisions also require that
#provincial laws be enacted and
#published in both languages, and
#that both languages be used in
#the Records and Journals of
#their legislatures.
#Minority-language
#educational rights
#• Every province and territory
#has official language minority
#communities (French-speaking
#communities outside Quebec
#and English-speaking minorities
#in Quebec).
#• Outside Quebec, citizens whose
#mother tongue is French, or who
#have attended French primary
#or secondary schools in Canada,
#have a constitutional right to have
#all their children receive primary
#or secondary instruction in that
#language. This is also true if their
#children are, or have, attended
#French primary or secondary
#schools in Canada.
#• In Quebec, citizens
#who received their
#primary education in
#English in Quebec, or
#who have a child who
#was or is being taught
#in English in Quebec,
#have the constitutional
#right to send all
#their children to
#English-language
#schools.
#This right to minori-
#ty-language instruction
#applies where numbers
#warrant, and can include
#the right to receive that instruction
#in minority-language educational
#facilities provided out of public funds.
#Aboriginal and treaty rights
#As noted earlier, section 35 of the
#Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes
#and affirms the Aboriginal and
#treaty rights of Aboriginal peoples.
#The Charter cannot take away or
#diminish those rights, or any other
#rights or freedoms that Aboriginal
#peoples may acquire in the future
#(for example, from the settlement
#of land claims).
#The Charter and
#the Constitution
#protect the rights
#of the Aboriginal
#peoples (Indian,
#Inuit, and Métis)
#of Canada.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E20
#Other Rights
#The Charter guarantees many basic
#human rights and fundamental
#freedoms. But we all have other rights
#that come from federal, provincial,
#territorial, international, and
#common law. Also, Parliament or
#a provincial or territorial legislature
#can always add to our rights.

#The federal and provincial and terri-

#for the judicial system in Canada.
#Only the federal government can
#appoint and pay judges of the
#superior, or upper-level, courts in
#the provinces. Parliament can also
#establish a general court of appeal
#and other courts. It has created the
#Supreme Court of Canada, the
#Federal Court and the Federal Court
#of Appeal, as well as the Tax Court.
#Parliament also has exclusive
#authority over the procedure in
#courts that try criminal cases.
#Federal authority for criminal law
#and procedure ensures fair and
#consistent treatment of criminal
#behaviour across the country.
#The provinces administer justice
#in their jurisdictions. This includes
#organizing and maintaining the civil
#and criminal provincial courts and
#civil procedure in those courts.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E22
#What Do the Federal Courts Do?
#The Supreme Court of Canada
#is Canada’s final court of appeal.
#Its nine judges represent the four
#major regions of the country.
#Three of them must be from
#Quebec, to adequately represent
#the civil law system.
#The Supreme Court has two main
#functions.
#• It hears appeals from decisions
#of the appeal courts in all the
#provinces and territories, as well
#as from the Federal Court of Appeal.
#Supreme Court judgments are final.
#• It decides important questions about
#the Constitution and controversial
#or complicated areas of private and
#public law. The government can
#also ask the Supreme Court for
#its opinion on important legal
#questions.
#The federal government also
#established the Federal Court, the
#Tax Court and the Federal Court
#of Appeal.
#The Federal Court specializes in
#areas such as intellectual property,
#maritime law, federal–provincial
#disputes, and civil cases related
#to terrorism.
#The Tax Court specializes in hearing
#appeals from tax assessments.
#The Federal Court of Appeal reviews
#the decisions of both these courts.
#In fact, it is the highest court of the
#land for about 95 percent of all cases.
#Provincial and Territorial
#Level Courts
#The court system is roughly the same
#across Canada. Except for Nunavut,
#each province has three levels: provincial
#and territorial, or lower, courts;
#superior courts; and appeal courts.
#The Nunavut Court of Justice has
#a single-level trial court.
#Provincial and Territorial Courts
#Provincial courts try most criminal
#offences, money matters and family
#matters. In private-law cases involving
#breach of contract or other claims of
#harm, the courts apply common-law
#principles in nine provinces and the
#territories. In Quebec, courts apply
#the Quebec Civil Code.
#Provincial courts may also include
#specialized courts, such as youth
#courts, family courts, and small
#claims courts. Each provincial
#government appoints the judges
#for its own courts.
#23C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#Superior Courts
#Superior courts are the highest level
#of courts in a province or territory.
#They deal with the most serious
#criminal and civil cases and have
#the power to review the decisions
#of the provincial and territorial courts.
#Superior courts are divided into two
#levels: trial level and appeal level.
#• The trial-level courts hear civil and
#criminal cases. They may be called
#the Supreme Court, the Court of
#Queen’s Bench, or the Superior
#Court of Justice.
#• The appeal-level courts, or Courts
#of Appeal, hear civil and criminal
#appeals from the superior trial
#courts listed above.
#Although the provinces and territories
#administer superior courts, the
#federal government appoints and
#pays the judges.
#Administrative Boards
#and Tribunals
#There are other kinds of disputes
#that do not need to be dealt with
#in the courts. Different kinds of
#administrative tribunals and boards
#deal with disputes over
#the interpretation and
#application of laws and
#regulations, such as enti-
#tlement to employment
#insurance or disability
#benefits, refugee claims,
#and human rights.
#Administrative tribunals
#are less formal than
#courts and are not part
#of the court system.
#However, they play an
#essential role in resolving disputes
#in Canadian society. Decisions of
#administrative tribunals may be
#reviewed in court to ensure that
#tribunals act fairly and according
#to the law.
#Administrative
#tribunals play an
#essential role in
#resolving disputes in
#Canadian society.

#A civil case is a private case where
#someone sues someone else. This is
#also known as a suit or action. In a
#criminal case, the Crown prosecutes
#an accused under a public-law statute
#such as the Criminal Code or the
#Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
#How Do Civil Cases Work?
#A civil action or suit starts when
#individuals or corporations disagree
#on a legal matter, such as the terms of
#a contract or the ownership of a piece
#of property. A civil suit can also result
#if someone is injured or property is
#damaged. For example, someone who
#breaks a leg when he or she slips on
#an icy stairwell may sue for compen-
#sation. The person who sues is called
#the plaintiff. The person being sued is
#called the defendant.
#Civil cases are complex. A suit goes
#through several stages: pleadings,
#discovery, and the trial itself.
#Pleading
#First, the plaintiff files a pleading
#with the court. This sets out the
#complaint against the defendant and
#the remedy the plaintiff is seeking.
#A court officer then issues the claim
#by affixing the seal of the court and
#signing the pleading on behalf of the
#court. Copies are then delivered to,
#or served on, the defendant.
#The defendant must provide the
#court with a statement of defence.
#If she or he does not, the court will
#assume that the plaintiff’s allegations
#are true. The defendant may thus
#lose by default.
#Both the plaintiff and the defendant
#are entitled to consult a lawyer.
#Lawyers often discuss the lawsuit to
#settle it before a trial is necessary.
#The two sides can reach a settlement
#at any time before the judge makes his
#or her decision. In fact, 98 percent of
#civil suits never make it to the courts.
#Discovery
#Each party is then entitled to an
#examination for discovery before the
#trial. Its purpose is to clarify the claim
#against the defendant and lets each
#side examine the evidence that the
#other side intends to use in court.
#Trial
#During the trial, it is up to the
#plaintiff to present facts to support
#the claim against the defendant. In a
#civil suit, the plaintiff must prove that
#it is probable that the defendant is
#legally responsible, or liable, because
#CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES
#25C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#a civil case is decided on a balance
#of probabilities. This is the standard
#of proof for a civil case, just as the
#standard of proof for a criminal
#case is proof beyond a reasonable
#doubt.
#If the facts justify the remedy the
#plaintiff is seeking, the court will
#hold the defendant liable, or legally
#responsible.
#What Happens at a Civil Trial?
#The trial begins with the plaintiff
#presenting evidence against the
#defendant. The plaintiff may call
#witnesses to testify to facts and
#present evidence: papers, photographs
#or other documents. The defendant
#may cross-examine the plaintiff’s
#witnesses to test their evidence.
#The defendant then presents his or
#her own evidence, including witnesses.
#The plaintiff has the same right to
#cross-examine.
#Throughout the trial, the judge
#must make sure that all the evidence
#presented and all the questions asked
#are relevant to the case. For example,
#in most situations, the judge will
#not allow testimony based on what
#a witness has heard from another
#person – this is called hearsay
#evidence.
#At the end, both the plaintiff and
#the defendant summarize their
#arguments. The judge must then
#consider the evidence presented
#before making a decision, based on
#what has been proven to be most
#probable. He or she must decide
#whether the facts show that the
#defendant has broken a civil law,
#such as a law that says we are obliged
#to fulfill our contracts.
#Depending on the suit and the court,
#the defendant may have a right to a
#trial by judge and jury. It is then up
#to the jury to decide which version
#of the facts it believes. The judge
#still decides which law applies and
#explains the evidence and the relevant
#laws to the jury. The jury must
#then consider the matter and reach
#a verdict.
#How a Trial Ends
#If the defendant is found not liable,
#the judge will dismiss the case.
#If the defendant is found liable,
#the judge or jury must consider
#three things:
#• the remedy that the plaintiff asked
#for in the pleadings;
#• the facts; and
#• how to compensate the plaintiff.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E26
#Remedies
#A remedy is a means of resolving a
#civil case. There are three different
#types.
#• Monetary remedies, called damages,
#are the most common. The judge
#or jury who decides the case fixes
#the amount of damages. The judge
#or jury will take into account the
#expenses incurred by the plaintiff.
#Where the law permits,
#they can also award an
#additional sum to
#compensate the plaintiff
#for the loss suffered as a
#result of the wrongdoing
#of the defendant.
#The judge or jury is not
#required to award the
#plaintiff the amount
#he or she asks for. They
#might even award less
#than that amount. In
#Canada, a judge or jury
#may occasionally award
#“punitive” damages.
#This is a larger award that
#expresses the disapproval
#of the community. These
#damages are meant to
#punish the defendant
#because the defendant’s
#behaviour was so
#offensive.
#• Declaratory remedies simply state
#the rights of the parties. For example,
#when a court interprets a will or
#decides who owns personal property
#or land, its decision is declaratory.
#• An injunction is a restraining order
#that says that someone can or
#cannot do something. You could get
#an injunction to stop your neigh-
#bours from burning garbage or to
#order them to remove a junk heap
#from your property. Injunctions are
#not given automatically. In each
#case, the court has the discretion to
#make such an order or to award
#damages according to precedent.
#What Are Criminal Cases?
#A crime is considered to be an offence
#against society as a whole, so it is
#usually the state that starts a criminal
#prosecution.
#Criminal offences are set out in the
#Criminal Code or in other federal
#laws. There are two types:
#• Summary conviction offences,
#which are the most minor cases,
#for example causing a disturbance;
#and
#• Indictable offences, which are more
#serious and include theft, break and
#enter, and murder.
#In 2011–12, cases
#involving impaired
#driving (11%),
#theft (10%),
#common assault
#(10%), and failure
#to comply with an
#order (9%) were
#the most common
#types of cases
#completed in adult
#criminal court.
#27C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#The person charged with a criminal
#offence is called the accused.
#The accused is always presumed
#innocent until proven guilty.
#Summary Offences
#The accused appears before a provincial
#court judge for a trial that will
#normally proceed immediately.
#The maximum penalty for this type
#of offence is normally a $5,000 fine,
#six months in prison, or both.
#Indictable Offences
#An accused has three choices:
#• Have a judge alone hear the case
#in provincial court.
#• Have a judge and jury hear the
#case in a superior court.
#• Have a judge alone hear the case
#in superior court.
#There may be a preliminary hearing
#before a trial, during which a judge
#examines the case to decide if there
#is enough evidence to proceed with
#the trial. If the judge decides there is
#not enough evidence, the case will
#be dismissed.
#Otherwise, the judge will order a
#full trial.
#What Happens in an Arrest?
#The police must follow certain
#procedures to protect the rights of
#the accused. A person who has been
#arrested is first read their rights.
#The police must
#• tell the person that he
#or she has the right to
#consult a lawyer
#without delay;
#• explain the reasons for
#the arrest and the
#specific charge, if one
#is being made.
#What Happens in
#Custody?
#A person who is taken
#into custody goes to a
#holding cell in a deten-
#tion centre. He or she
#has the right to appear
#before a justice of the
#peace or judge as soon as
#possible (usually within
#24 hours). At that time a judge
#decides on pre-trial release or bail.
#In a bail hearing, the prosecutor
#must show why the accused should
#remain in custody. If a judge decides
#the accused should be released,
#the accused may be released with or
#without conditions. Release on bail
#will only be refused if there are very
#strong reasons for doing so.
#A crime is
#considered to be
#an offence against
#society as a whole,
#so it is usually
#the state that
#starts a criminal
#prosecution.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E28
#Anyone accused of
#a crime also has the
#right under the Charter
#to stand trial within
#“a reasonable time.”
#The Charter does not
#say what this means but
#the courts have provided
#some guidance. A judge
#considers four factors
#to determine if a trial
#is happening within a
#reasonable time:
#• the length of the delay;
#• the reason for the
#delay;
#• whether the accused agreed to
#a delayed trial date;
#• whether the delay affected the
#accused’s ability to put forward
#to a fair defence.
#What Happens in a
#Criminal Trial?
#A criminal trial is a very serious
#matter. After all, the accused has
#a lot to lose: his or her liberty and
#the stigma of a criminal conviction.
#Because of that, both common law and
#the Charter protect the rights of the
#accused. For example, the prosecution
#must prove that the accused is guilty of
#the charge beyond a reasonable
#doubt. Also, if any evidence is
#obtained that violates the accused’s
#Charter rights, such as through an
#unreasonable search and seizure,
#the judge may refuse to admit the
#evidence. In a criminal trial, an
#accused person cannot be required
#by the prosecution to give evidence.
#Decisions in Criminal Cases
#If the accused is found not guilty,
#he or she will be acquitted and is
#then free to go.
#If the accused is found guilty of a
#crime, the judge must decide the
#appropriate sentence. When making
#this decision, the judge must consider:
#• the seriousness of the crime;
#• the range of sentences possible in
#the Criminal Code or other statutes;
#• preventing or deterring the offender
#or others from committing similar
#crimes;
#• denouncing the harm to the victim
#and the illegal conduct; and
#• the prospects for rehabilitation.
#Judges may impose many different
#kinds of sentences or a combination

#year, to 117 days.

#of penalties. These may include:
#• A fine (a sum of money);
#• Restitution: asking the offender
#to pay costs of injuries or loss of
#damage to property;
#• Probation: release of the offender
#with conditions;
#• Community service: an order
#that the offender perform a certain
#number of hours of volunteer
#work in the community;
#• Imprisonment: confinement in
#a prison or penitentiary.
#An offender who is sentenced to
#more than two years will be sent to
#a federal penitentiary. An offender
#who is sentenced to two years or less
#will go to a provincial prison.
#A judge does not always have to
#convict, even if the accused person
#has pleaded guilty or been found
#guilty. The judge may give an
#offender an absolute or conditional
#discharge. An offender given a
#conditional discharge must obey
#the conditions imposed by the judge
#or face a more severe sentence.
#An offender who is given a discharge
#will not receive a criminal record
#for the offence.
#Can You Appeal a Decision?
#The right to appeal a court’s decision
#is an important safeguard in our legal
#system because a court could make
#an error in a trial.
#In most civil and criminal cases,
#a decision made at one level of the
#court system can be appealed to a
#higher level. Where there is no right
#to appeal, permission or
#“leave” to appeal must
#be sought. The higher
#court may deny leave to
#appeal, affirm or reverse
#the original decision. In
#some cases, it will order
#a new trial.
#Both sides in a civil case
#and either the prosecu-
#tion or the accused in
#a criminal case may
#appeal.
#Sometimes, it is only
#the amount of damages
#or the severity of the
#sentence that is appealed.
#For example, the accused may ask
#a higher court to reduce a sentence,
#or the prosecution may ask to have
#the sentence increased.
#The right to appeal
#a court’s decision
#is an important
#safeguard in our
#legal system because
#a court could
#make an error
#in a trial.
#30
#The criminal law process is funda-
#mentally between the accused and
#the state. But there is increasing
#recognition of the importance of
#hearing victims and they are starting
#to have a greater voice and role in
#the legal process.
#There is federal legislation and
#services to help victims.
#For example, under the
#Criminal Code:
#• the victim’s safety must be
#considered in bail decisions;
#• a victim’s identity may be protected
#in appropriate circumstances;
#• judges must consider victim impact
#statements and the harm to the
#victim; and
#• offenders may be ordered to pay
#restitution (an amount of money
#to reimburse the victim for losses
#caused by the offender) as part of
#the sentence. They also have to
#pay a victim surcharge.
#Victims are not allowed to decide if
#an appeal is brought or not because
#the process is between the accused
#and the state.
#The victim can receive some information
#about an offender while that person is
#an offender if it is relevant to the
#victim’s safety – for example, if the
#offender is released once a week for
#counselling. Even if the victim
#is not in harm’s way, he or she could
#still be traumatized by seeing the
#offender shopping in the same
#neighbourhood. The victim’s physical
#well-being and psychological safety
#are considered equally important.
#The federal government and provinces
#work together on how victims are
#served. For example, Canada and the
#provinces agreed to a baseline set of
#principles that govern all policies
#and legislation called the Canadian
#Statement of Basic Principles.
#The Canadian Victims Bill of Rights
#came into force in 2015 to improve the
#experiences of victims of crime across
#the country by creating, at the federal
#level, clear rights for victims of crime
#– a first in Canadian history. To read
#the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights
#in full, please visit the Justice Laws
#website. You can find out more about
#victim-related issues in Canada at
#canada.ca. There are also many services
#available across the country for victims
#of crime - consult the Victim Services

#VICTIMS OF CRIME
#31
#Restorative justice came into the
#system from Aboriginal justice
#traditions. Restorative justice empha-
#sizes the wrong done to a person as
#well as the wrong done to the
#community. It recognizes that crime
#is both a violation of relationships
#between specific people and an
#offence against everyone (the state).
#In restorative justice programs, the
#victim of the crime, the offender and,
#ideally, members of the community
#voluntarily participate in discussions.
#The goal is
#• to restore the relationship;
#• to fix the damage that has been
#done; and
#• to prevent further crimes from
#occurring.
#Restorative justice requires
#wrongdoers
#• to recognize the harm they
#have caused;
#• to accept responsibility for
#their actions;
#• to be actively involved in
#improving the situation; and
#• to make amends to victims and
#the community.
#RESTORATIVE JUSTICE
#32
#YOUTH JUSTICE
#Special considerations come into play
#when young people commit acts that
#are considered criminal. The Youth
#Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) is the
#federal law that governs Canada’s
#youth justice system. It applies to
#youth aged 12 to 17 who get into
#trouble with the law. The YCJA
#recognizes that young persons must
#be held accountable for criminal acts,
#although not in the same way or to
#the same extent as adults. It is in
#society’s interest to ensure that as
#many young offenders as possible are
#rehabilitated and become productive
#members of society.
#The YCJA recognizes
#that young people lack
#the maturity of adults.
#The youth justice system
#includes measures that
#are consistent with this
#reduced level of maturi-
#ty. The YCJA also
#recognizes that young
#people have special
#needs and circumstances
#that must be considered
#when any decision is
#made under the Act.
#While many aspects of
#criminal procedure are
#similar in the youth and
#adult criminal justice systems, the
#YCJA establishes special procedures
#to ensure that young people are
#treated fairly and to promote their
#rehabilitation. For example, as a
#general rule, the privacy of young
#offenders and young victims and
#witnesses is protected through
#publication bans on their identity.
#The YCJA says that young people are
#to be held accountable in ways that
#are fair and in proportion to the
#seriousness of their offences. These
#interventions should
#• reinforce respect for societal values;
#• encourage the repair of harm done;
#• be meaningful to the offender;
#• respect gender, ethnic, cultural, and
#linguistic differences; and
#• respond to the needs of Aboriginal
#young persons and of young
#persons with special requirements.
#The YCJA encourages the use of
#measures outside of the formal court
#system for less serious offences.
#These measures are often the most
#appropriate and effective way to respond
#to youth offending, and include options
#such police warnings and referrals to
#community-based programs.
#The Youth
#Criminal Justice
#Act says that young
#people are to be
#held accountable in
#ways that are fair
#and in proportion
#to the seriousness of
#their offences.
#33C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#Youth cases that do end up in the
#formal court system are conducted in
#special youth courts. If a youth is
#found guilty of a criminal offence,
#the youth court judge must deter-
#mine the appropriate sentence. The
#YCJA has specific sentencing provi-
#sions for young offenders that are
#different than the adult sentencing
#provisions in the Criminal Code.
#In most cases, judges impose one of
#the youth sentencing options in the
#YCJA. However, in very serious cases,
#the court does have the power to
#impose an adult
#sentence. If an adult
#sentence is imposed, the
#Criminal Code penalties
#for adult offenders are
#applied to the young
#person. This can include
#mandatory minimum
#penalties and sentences
#up to life imprisonment.
#However, a young
#person cannot serve any
#portion of a sentence in
#an adult prison before he
#or she is 18 years old.
#Canadian youth
#courts completed
#about 48,000
#cases in 2011–12,
#down 10% from
#the previous
#year. The largest
#decreases were in the
#territories, where
#declines ranged from
#23% to 36%.
#34
#In Canada, each of us has a part in
#ensuring that the law works properly
#and that justice is done. Two ways
#of contributing to justice in Canada
#are being on a jury and testifying
#in court.
#Jury Duty
#Serving on a jury is one way a citizen
#can carry out his or her role. A jury
#is a group of citizens who try an
#accused charged with a criminal
#offence. In Canada, a criminal law
#jury is made up of 12 jurors selected
#from among citizens of the province
#or territory in which the court is
#located. Any adult Canadian citizen
#can be considered for jury duty.
#Being called for jury duty does not
#mean a person will be selected to
#serve as a juror but he or she must
#show up for the selection process.
#Some people may not be required
#to do jury duty by the laws of their
#province. Also, the prosecutor or the
#defence counsel may object to a
#particular juror if they believe there
#is a reason why he or she should be
#disqualified.
#During the trial, jurors must not
#allow themselves to be influenced by
#anything except the evidence presented
#in court. Jurors must make up
#their own minds about the truth
#or honesty of the testimony given
#by witnesses.
#After both sides have called all their
#witnesses and presented their arguments,
#the judge instructs the jury on the
#law and on what they must take into
#account when making their decision.
#Criminal Cases
#The jurors meet in a room outside
#the courtroom to decide whether
#the prosecutor has proven beyond
#a reasonable doubt that the accused
#is guilty.
#All the jurors must agree on the
#decision or verdict – their decision
#must be unanimous. If they cannot
#all agree, the judge may discharge
#the jury and direct a new jury to be
#chosen for a new trial. After a trial,
#jurors are not allowed to tell anyone
#else about the discussions that took
#place in the jury room.
#Civil Cases
#The jury must decide whether the
#plaintiff has proven that the defendant
#is liable, that is, responsible, on a
#balance of probabilities.
#THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC
#35C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E
#There are only six jurors in a civil
#case, and the decision does not have
#to be unanimous as long as five of
#them agree on the verdict.
#Testifying in Court
#A person who has information that
#either party in the case believes to be
#useful may be called to give evidence
#in a civil or criminal trial. Someone
#might have witnessed the event,
#know something that is important to
#the case, or have a document that is
#key to the trial.
#People whose knowledge about a
#particular subject can help the court
#with answers to technical questions
#may also be called as expert witnesses.
#If people have information they
#believe is related to the case, they may
#come forward voluntarily. If they
#do not, they can be summoned by
#subpoena to give evidence in court.
#A person who is subpoenaed must
#testify or face a penalty.
#Witnesses must take an oath or affirm
#that they will tell the truth. They
#must answer all questions they are
#asked, unless the judge decides that
#a question is irrelevant.
#Know the Law
#People do not have to be experts
#in the law. But ignorance of the law
#is no excuse or defence. If you are
#charged with an offence, for example,
#you cannot be excused by claiming
#that you did not know you were
#breaking the law. Because our laws
#are publicly debated before being
#passed in Parliament or a legislature,
#the public is expected to know what
#is legal and what is not.
#The duty to know the law means that
#citizens should make sure they are
#Trial by Jury
#Most civil cases in Canada are tried
#by judges without a jury. However,
#anyone charged with a criminal
#offence for which there can be a
#prison sentence of five years or
#more has the right to a trial by jury.
#In some cases, a person charged
#with a criminal offence for which
#there can be a prison sentence of
#less than five years may have the
#right to choose trial by jury.
#Some civil cases can also be tried
#by judge and jury.
#C A N A D A ’ S S Y S T E M O F J U S T I C E36
#acting legally. You can
#find this information
#from federal, provincial
#and territorial government
#offices, public libraries,
#public legal information
#associations, and the
#police. If, after consulting
#these sources of informa-
#tion, you are still
#uncertain about the law,
#then you should consult
#a lawyer.
#Who Gets Legal Aid?
#Legal help for low-income people
#is as important as health care and
#education. The federal and provincial
#governments have set up a program
#to share the cost of legal services for
#those who qualify. Any person who
#meets the financial criteria and who
#is accused of a crime for which a
#conviction might mean jail or loss
#of livelihood may get legal aid.
#Some provinces also offer legal aid
#for civil cases, particularly in
#family-law matters.

#
#While Widgets do not appear in Rhythm Tengoku, rods known as Akai Mono (赤いモノ?, Red Objects) do appear in the Rhythm Game Polyrhythm. They are industry products whose details are kept a trade secret. They are considered hazardous because they explode when colliding with walls[1]. In the game, the rods roll along two raised paths, and the player must press the corresponding button to raise the blocks when they reach a gap.
#Widget DS.png
#
#Widgets make their first actual appearance in Rhythm Heaven in Built to Scale, where they are portrayed as a white rod and nuts. The player must wait for the nuts to roll into place, then launch the rod into them to form the Widget. They later appear in Built to Scale 2, this time colored red. Workers are instructed to follow the rhythm while producing the Widgets, but they get paid the same regardless[2].

#The square mass-produced objects appear again in Rhythm Heaven Fever and Rhythm Heaven Megamix in Built to Scale, where the player must bounce around a rod while waiting for two nuts to come into place, after which the player must launch the rod into them to form the complete Widget. The company sometimes makes defective products, and a worker in product testing accidentally sold the bad parts to collectors for a lot of money[3].

#
#    Although Akai Mono and Widgets are presented as the "character" the Rhythm Games they appear in, there are actual human characters depicted in the epilogues of each game. In Rhythm Tengoku, the factory is depicted, with what may be the owner standing outside. In Rhythm Heaven, a man is depicted inspecting the completed Widgets. In Rhythm Heaven Fever and Rhythm Heaven Megamix, the worker behind the building process is depicted standing outside the Widget Factory.
#    While the rods used to connect the Widgets in Built to Scale in Rhythm Heaven Fever and Rhythm Heaven Megamix are never referred to as anything in-game, comments left in the internal data refers to them as "Akai Mono"[4] like the rods in Polyrhythm.

#This top section summarizes the terms below. This summary is provided to help your understanding of the terms, but be sure to read the entire document, because when you agree to it, you are indicating you accept all of the terms, not just this summary.
#
#    Mozilla accounts (the "Services") include your account and the suite of services provided to you by Mozilla using that account.
#    The Services are provided "as is" and there are no warranties of any kind. There are significant limits on Mozilla's liability for any damages arising from your use of the Services.
#
#Terms of Service
#
#    Introduction
#
#    These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Mozilla accounts, a suite of online services provided by Mozilla (the "Services").
#    Mozilla Accounts
#
#    In order to use some of the Services, you'll need to create a Mozilla account. During registration, you will be asked to set a password. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential and for the activity that happens through your Mozilla account. Mozilla is not responsible for any losses arising out of unauthorized use of your Mozilla account.
#    Services
#
#    (a) Mozilla VPN is a Virtual Private Network in partnership with Mullvad. A Mozilla account is required.
#
#    (b) Firefox Relay allows you to keep your primary email address safe and private from online services by making unique, alias email addresses that allow you to send and receive emails without revealing your primary email address. A Mozilla account is required.
#
#    (c) Firefox Monitor is an informational service to promote online security by informing you of public data breaches. You can scan email addresses on our website to see most publicly known breaches. If you subscribe with a Mozilla account, you will receive:
#        Full Report: This includes a complete list of publicly known hacks, including breaches of sensitive websites, such as those for children or adult and dating sites (these sites are excluded from website scans in order to protect the privacy of those individuals).
#        Breach Alerts: This notifies you if your email address appears in a new data breach.
#        Safety Tips: This sends you occasional online safety tips from Mozilla.
#
#    It is your responsibility to protect your online accounts using strong and different passwords, security questions, two-factor authentication, password managers, and other safety measures. Although Firefox Monitor and Have I Been Pwned? strive to have current data, there is no guarantee that either will have complete or timely records of all public data breaches.
#
#    (d) Firefox Notes lets you take notes in Firefox. A Mozilla account is required to view, edit, and delete your Notes across devices.
#
#    (e) Firefox sync lets you access information stored in Firefox across devices, including your tabs, awesome bar, passwords, bookmarks, and browser preferences. You can enable and disable Firefox sync through the Settings section of Firefox. A Mozilla account is required.
#
#    (f) Pocket helps you discover great content that’s personalized to your interests and save this content so you can return to it later – on any device, at any time.
#    Privacy Policy

You may receive these in-product or to the address you signed-up with; they cover onboarding, different Mozilla account services, and related offers and surveys. You may also choose to receive other types of email messages.
#
#    You can change your email subscriptions with Mozilla from our emails (click the link at the bottom) or from the browser (visit Firefox / Preferences / Sync / Manage account / Email Preferences).
#
#    We may also send you important account information such as updates to legal or privacy terms, or security messages like password resets, email verification, and linked devices. These are necessary to our services and cannot be unsubscribed from. You can contact Mozilla at Mozilla Corporation Attn: Mozilla – Legal Notices 149 New Montgomery St, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 or legal-notices@mozilla.com
#    Your Content in Our Services
#
#    You may upload content to Mozilla as part of the features of the Services. By uploading content, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use your content to provide the Services. You hereby represent and warrant that your content will not infringe the rights of any third party and will comply with any content guidelines presented by Mozilla.

For example, these Terms do not provide the right to use any of Mozilla's copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
#    Term; Termination
#
#    These Terms will continue to apply until ended by either you or Mozilla. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by deleting your Mozilla account, discontinuing your use of the Services, and if applicable, unsubscribing from our emails.
#
#    We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your Mozilla account or the next time you attempt to access the Services.
#
#    In all such cases, these Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: Indemnification, Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability, Miscellaneous.
#    Indemnification
#
#    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mozilla, its contractors, contributors, licensors, and partners, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents ("Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of the Services (including, but not limited to, from any content uploaded by you).
#    Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability

#    THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGING. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING THE SERVICES FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RISK THAT YOUR CONTENT IS DELETED OR CORRUPTED OR THAT SOMEONE ELSE ACCESSES YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#
#    EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT AND INDIRECT DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, AND COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED. THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $500 (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#    Modifications to these Terms
#
#    Mozilla may update these Terms from time to time to address a new Service, feature of the Services, or to clarify a provision. The updated Terms will be posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums.

If any portion of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these terms and the English language version, the English language version shall control.

# This is a component in a component based project. Keep reading for more details
 
# Component Type: Input Helper

# Description:

# This component is used in the Godot game engine to detect when the "Left Arrow" button on a keyboard is 
# currently pressed down. This can be used in a movement script to detect if the player wishes to move in
# the "Left" direction

# If you are unaware of what the direction of "Left" refers to, here is an excerpt from the dictionary.

# on, toward, or relating to the side of a human body or of a thing that is to the west when the person 
# or thing is facing north.

# Functions:

# Detect():

# The detect function in the component that returns true if the left arrow is pressed will return the "True" boolean value
# if the user is pressing the "Left Arrow" key. If the "Left Arrow" key is currently being pressed on the frame that the
# Detect function is being called, it will return the value "True". If the "Left Arrow" key is currently not being pressed
# on the frame that the Detect function is being called, it will return "False".

# Thanks for reading!

@export var DetectIfLeftArrowIsBeingPressed = true 
# This is a variable that can be set to decide whether or not the script
# will check if the "Left arrow" key is being pressed down. If this variable is set to the boolean value of "True", it will
# cause the Detect function to return the value declared in the variable ReturnValueIfTheComponentIsSetToNotDetectIfLeftArrow
# IsBeingPressed.
